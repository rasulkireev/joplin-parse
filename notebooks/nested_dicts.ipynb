       "  'body': \"08/05/2020\\n\\n## A scene from last week\\n\\nLoved the comparison with the Thanksgiving. There are set of tools to make a product for the audience.  \\n\\n> In other words, it’s not a big fucking deal.\\n\\n## Always consider you guest \\n\\nThings we consume are personal. So when you are thinking of making something don't forget to ask.\\n\\n– What do these people like?  \\n– What do they need?\\n\\nRespect your customers time by making the product less time consuming (e.g, tightly focused book).\\n\\n> Learn what they need & want. Learn what they hate, what makes them sick, what they never value enough to pay for. \\nLearn what they do buy. Apply it to your paid products and your free stuff, too — from blog posts to apps to books to conferences. \\nThat’s how you craft a menu (and a product) that will appeal.\\n\\n## Set a deadline… and mean it\\n\\n> Product launches require anticipation, and anticipation requires a date & time. And you can’t launch what you haven’t fi nished. \\nSo pick a deadline. And mean it.\\n\\nDon't think of the deadline as a deadline, more like a challenge. \\n\\n> Finding that no matter how many deadlines you set, you never meet any of them? Refer back to that “Do you really want it?” sidebar in the introduction.\\n\\n\\n## Work Backwards \\n\\nMake a plan, or in other words, draw a map, in reverse. \\n\\nThese questions are the place to start: \\n – What’s the end result look like, exactly? \\n – How many chapters/videos/features?  – What is absolutely required, what’s nice to have? \\n – How perfect does it have to be? \\n – How long will each of these take? \\n – What has to come fi rst? \\n – What do I need to prepare? \\n – How long will that take? \\n – What do I need to fi nd out? \\n – How long will that take? \\n – How much, or how little, def i nes success? And who controls that?\\n\\n## Get Crispy\\n\\n> You need to get specific\\n\\n> Even given the most modest and boring topic in the world, you could go on for hundreds and hundreds… and hundreds… and hundreds… of pages. Charles Darwin wrote a 673-page book on barnacles. And that was just volume 1!\\n\\n## Start Small\\n\\n> Start small. Start with a single, perfect dish. You can always go bigger. You don't lose a thing.\\n\\nOne thing I keep noticing with myself at least is that I love examples. I think this is true for other people. It is so much more easier to learn by example, when you can see how one applies a method that is being taught. \\n\\n> Start with the tiny little things you can finish, and especially those you can use to make bigger things, and make you feel good about making actual forward motion.\\n\\nSometimes when I finish something I don't even take time to celebrate, I just move onto the next thing, forgetting that the previous was done. Again that's me, but it might be a recurring thing with entrepreneurs. Chasing the next thing. \\n\\n> Remember, always consider your guest. They don’t care if you used a pre-built library instead of writing all of your code from scratch. They don’t care if your Wordpress theme is 100% original.\\n\\nThis is soooo crucial to learn, but hard to implement. \\n\\n## Track your progress\\n\\n> There’s nothing as gratifiyng as watching your work shape up before your very eyes.\\n\\n> With software, writing, design, teaching — the process is far less tangible, less final. It takes a lot longer. It’s easier to get dispirited. It can feel like you’ve spent a lot of time doing nothing, and yet you’re still not done.\\n\\nUse kanban to drag things along. Track your time.\\n\\n## Shop the shelf\\n\\n > Remember — your job isn’t to just “make a thing the bestest” — it’s to just fucking ship, because the goal is to get your project or product into the hands of someone who will use it.\\n\\nDon't reinvent the wheels. \\n\\n\",\n",

When we are learning coding one of the hard things to ifgure out is what caused what. It doesn\\'t help that often in tutorials different things are called the same. For instance, let\\'s say you are working on a form and you need to specify the name of the input \"email\", then you also need to v-model it to data, and you use the same name \"email\". Even those are related, they do not affect each other. For this reason it would make sense to name the data component to be called \"dataEmail\" or something like that so that if we later refer to one or the other we know exactly what we are referring to.',\n",

I hope you also have small or large things to celebrate during the week. Each day, I understand this more and more.\\n\\nIn the last couple of days I relized I have totally lot my mojo. Rigth before the pandemic started I was going to bed at 10, wking up at 6, exercising, building web stuff, then going to work. At work was productive and went back home early to spend time with my wife. \\n\\nNow, I don\\'t have any of that. No early bed, no early, no exercise, etc... I know for sure that this is pandemic related. But what\\'s weird to me is that I always dreamt about remote work, now, it seems its not working out so great. I just can\\'t get the self-displine / self-control back in order.\\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n\\nAnyway, sorry about this long blabber. Let\\'s get to business. I hope you enjoy this week\\'s \"Tuesday Letter\" :)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📜 Quote of the week\\n\\n> Start with the tiny little things you can finish, and especially those you can use to make bigger things, and make you feel good about making actual forward motion.\\n\\nSometimes when I finish something I don\\'t even take time to celebrate, I just move onto the next thing, forgetting that the previous was done. Again that\\'s me, but it might be a recurring thing with entrepreneurs. Chasing the next thing. \\n\\n> There’s nothing as gratifiyng as watching your work shape up before your very eyes.\\n\\n> With software, writing, design, teaching — the process is far less tangible, less final. It takes a lot longer. It’s easier to get dispirited. It can feel like you’ve spent a lot of time doing nothing, and yet you’re still not done.\\n\\nUse kanban to drag things along. Track your time.\\n\\n> Remember — your job isn’t to just “make a thing the bestest” — it’s to just fucking ship, because the goal is to get your project or product into the hands of someone who will use it.\\n\\nDon\\'t reinvent the wheels. \\n\\n> [Just Fucking Ship](https://stackingthebricks.com/just-fucking-ship/) *by* [*Amy Hoy*](https://stackingthebricks.com/)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👉 ️Mentions\\n\\nThis week [Luke Plant](https://lukeplant.me.uk/) posted an awesome guide on Django Views. I haven\\'t finished it yet, so can\\'t give a full review, but it does look great, for beginners and experienced developers alike.\\n\\nThe reason I mention this post is that I got a mention and a backlink to one of [my django posts](https://rasulkireev.com/django-get-context-data/). This is the very first time for me. So thankful.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📚 Short Books\\n\\n3 Blindingly Obvious and Therefore Painfully Underappreciated Daily Actions That Will Change Your Life by [Jason Lengstorf](https://lengstorf.com/)\\n\\n**Action #1: Write a Daily List of Things That Matter**\\n\\n> When we write things down, they become less stressful and easier to prioritize.\\n\\n> A DAILY LIST HELPS BUILD (AND MAINTAIN) MOMENTUM AND MOTIVATION. Writing  a  list  of  just  a  few  items  —  the  things  that  are  most  important  for  today  —  and  crossing  all  of  them  off  is  far  more  motivational than crossing those same few items off a list with dozens of items on it.\\n\\n**Action #2: Actually Make Sleep as Important as We Always Pretend It Is.**\\n\\n**Action #3: Put Your Phone Down and Act Like a Person.**\\n\\n> Smartphones are great at solving problems that were caused by smartphones.\\n\\n[PDF file](https://lengstorf.com/downloads/3-obvious-habits.pdf)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 😁️ Person of the Week\\n\\n<img style=\"border-radius: 50%; width: 100px\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1282484097583943681/DjLtd68s_400x400.jpg\" alt=\"Stew Fortier\">\\n\\n[Stew Fortier](https://stewfortier.com/)\\n\\nStew is a former CTO for [Banzai](https://www.getbanzai.com/).

The most facinating thing with those, is that they all make sense, they all are simple, but each one is also hard to achieve. Each step requires great self-control, which I lack now. I think gaining such control over oneself is one of the best things you can do for growth.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '08/11/2020 15:55\\n\\n# Sort JSON array in Gridsome/Vuejs Template\\n\\nI decided to decouple my html from the data, as is best practice. So, I had a **Newsletter.vue** where the data is rendered and **newsletter.js** where the data is stored.\\n\\n \\n```html\\n// Newsletter.vue\\n<template>\\n    <Layout>\\n        <section id=\"letters\">\\n            <ul v-for=\"letter in newsletter.reverse()\" :key=\"letter.id\">\\n                <li>\\n                    <a :href=\"letter.url\">\\n                        {{ letter.title }}\\n                    </a>\\n                </li>\\n            </ul>\\n        </section>\\n    </Layout>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport { newsletterLetters } from \"../data/newsletter.js\"\\n\\nexport default {\\n    data () {\\n        return {\\n            newsletter: newsletterLetters,\\n        }\\n    },\\n}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nand **newsletter.js**\\n\\n```javascript\\nexport const newsletterLetters = [\\n    {\\n        id: 1,\\n        url: \\'https://buttondown.email/rasulkireev/archive/letter-1-fresh-start-correction/\\',\\n        title: \"Letter #1 - Fresh Start\",\\n        date: \\'2020/05/12\\',\\n    },\\n    ...\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThis caused an issue where the browser freezes on load (in production). Thanks to [Hans-Jørgen Vedvik](https://hjvedvik.com/), for the finding the error.\\n\\n> The newsletter array is added to the component data, which will make it reactive. And when `newsletter.reverse()` is called within the template, it will trigger an infinite update loop. Because `reverse()` mutates the original array. The issue can be fixed in numerous ways. But the simplest solution might be to just copy the array before reversing it, like: `newsletter.slice().reverse()`.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s exaclty what I did. It worked. Since you are reversing a copy of the array you are not going to run into an infinite loop problem.\\n',\n",

       "  'body': \"My quick life story is that I was born in Russia. Move to UK boarding school for my high school years, then got into Northeastern University in Boston, USA. After graduation, I moved to to new York to pursue a career in data analytics.\\n\\nEver since High School I chose to focus on mathematics & economics, which lead me to an actuarial career after graduation. The journey of finding a first full-time job was so hard that I decided to change something and decided to make a website. This got me started with Web Development. \\n\\nThis was a love at first sight, not quite as the love for my wife, but very close. From that day to today, which is roughly one and a half years I have been exploring this wonderful world of web development.\\n\\nAlong this journey I discovered Basecamp, the product and Basecamp, the company. Both were life changing for me. Basecamp the product showed me that a great product does not have to be too complex. Basecamp, the company showed me what it means to enjoy the work you do. Ever since reading Getting Real, Rework and other Basecamp books, learning more about the Basecamp ways I've set a goal to earn the spot to work for Basecamp.\\n\\nI believe I deserve a chance to prove myself for a position at Basecamp as a part of Core Product Team. Before I tell you what my strengths are, I'd like to take a humble second and tell you why I might not be the perfect candidate. \\n\\n1. I am not a Rails developer. \\nAll my experience in web development has been with Django, which is a Python based web development framework. Similar to what Rails is to Ruby. \\n\\n2. No CS degree\\nI don't have many years and years of experience. I also don't have formal education in Computer Science.\\n\\n3. Small experience in web development\\nOnly half a year of relevant experience (out of 3 total years)\\n\\n\\n\\nNow on to my strength.\\n\\n1. No CS degree\\nThe fact that I haven't gone through a CS degree, means I have learnt everything myself (I'll come back to this later). I have learnt to learn very efficiently (Meta). I had to learn be very careful and responsible with my time, due to the time constraints. \\n\\n2. Small professional experience\\nIt might look weird to put this into the advantage category, but hear me out. I haven't been poised with all of the unnecessary tools that are emerging in the web dev space. I have learned and improved only in things that mattered to me than to someone else. Thanks to this I have developed a love for the server-rendered HTML, progressively\\xa0enhanced\\xa0with\\xa0JavaScript\\xa0and CSS.\\n\\n3. Broad knowledge base\\nIn my short time of full-time work I have had exposure to many industries and professions. I worked as an Actuary, trying my best predict the future (whether a catastrophe or a credit default). \\n\\nI believe my strongest asset is my ability to learn. This may be a cliche and a very popular answer, but I mean it. There is one caveat though. This thing that I ought to learn must be of an interest to me.\\n\\nI have the required knowledge to start my work with Basecamp strong. I have the skills necessary to excel at my work with Basecamp.\",\n",

I hope you had a great start to the week and will have a fantastic rest of the week.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy this week\\'s \"Tuesday Letter\" :)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📜 Quote of the week\\n\\n> While it sounds easy, being concise is often more challenging than being verbose. Mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal recognized this in his native French, with a statement that translates roughly to “I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time” (a sentiment often attributed to Mark Twain).\\n\\n> [*Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals*](https://amzn.to/3f4bPQ9) *by* [*Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic*](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🛠️ Personal Projects\\n\\nThis week I published a [guide on adding multiple GraphQL queries with Gridsome](https://rasulkireev.com/multiple-gridsome-queries). Hopefully, this is a sign of me going back to more consistent writing. I plan to start writing more about Django.\\n\\nI used the premise of the guide to update the [Gridsome Documentation](https://gridsome.org/). This lead to me being added to Gridsome organization. Exciting! First Github organization I am a part of. Very motivating to continue contributing to open source projects.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 👓 Notes and Highlights\\n\\nI went through my [hypothesis](https://hypothes.is/) notes and found a few highlights that I would love to share.\\n\\n### How to Get a Job at a Remote Company\\n\\nThis is [post from Dynamitejobs](https://dynamitejobs.com/how-to-get-a-job-at-a-remote-company/). This was based on a conversation between Dynamitejobs and Nat Eliason.\\n\\n> We were fortunate enough to have Nat Eliason of Growth Machine sit down with our team and discuss how he assesses potential new team members. \\n\\n> Your resume and answers to the application are what will get you through the door in the first place.\\n> The application form is used to look for these qualifications:\\n>\\n> * Minimum Skills \\n> * Ability to Work Independently\\n> * Results from Previous Work\\n> * Can Improve Processes\\n> * Personality and Culture Fit\\n\\n\\n\\n### [How to Start a Blog that Changes Your Life by Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/start-a-blog)\\n\\nThat post is the bomb :fire: :fire: :fire:. Nat shares the learning from starting and growing his blog. He shares all the numbers, all the tactics, and every small detail that you might need to succeed yourself.\\n\\nBelow is the list of things that jumped at me the first time I was reading this piece. However, I encourage reading the whole thing. It is fascinating and is full of useful and actionable advice.\\n\\n> Way too many people obsess over launching with a perfect site and never go live. \\n\\n> Get over the fear and put yourself out there.\\n\\n#### What to Write About\\n\\n> That\\'s a combination of good SEO and good curation. People don\\'t want to read 10 articles or 30 guides. They want one great resource. Your job is to create an excellent resource for whatever you\\'re writing about.\\n\\n#### Finding Topics to Write About\\n\\n> If you write an \"I believe\" post, and you don\\'t piss some people off, you\\'re not doing it right.\\n\\n#### Surge Traffic\\n\\n> Reddit has so many people on it, and there are communities for everything. Whenever I published a post I thought would do well there, I would find a community I could share in, post it, and see what happened.\\n\\n> So what\\'s the secret to getting a big spike of traffic from Reddit? Unfortunately, it\\'s a fairly dull strategy: write a great article, find a good community to share it in, post it, maybe cheat a little bit by having 3-4 extra Reddit accounts upvote it, and cross your fingers. It won\\'t work most of the time, but when it does, it can be a game-changer.\\n\\n#### Evergreen traffic\\n\\n> you don\\'t want to waste your time by producing pieces that are only valuable for a few days.\\n\\n#### Audience Traffic\\n\\n> This is the ultimate goal for any blog. You want to build up a base of people who love what you write, and who will consider reading anything new you put out. It\\'s where the true value of the blog comes in, because it means you\\'re on people\\'s minds for certain kinds of opportunities or questions they might encounter.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t take long to convert me into such person. I think after reading 2-3 posts I was hooked on Nat\\'s writing.\\n\\n#### Affiliate Sales\\n\\n> For this site, the affiliate income has been nice, but it\\'s not massive, and not something I intend to optimize around. Treat affiliate income for a personal site as bonus money.\\n\\n\\n\\n### [I Just Hit $100k/yr On GitHub Sponsors! 🎉❤️ (How I Did It)](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it)\\n\\nHere’s how Sponsorware works:\\n\\n* Create a cool piece of software\\n* Make it exclusive to people who sponsor you until you reach a certain number of sponsors\\n* Then open source the project to the world\\n\\n> (To make all this happen I built a Laravel app with GitHub authentication that calls on the GitHub API to verify a user’s sponsorship)\\n> Now, people watching the screencasts will naturally encounter these “private” screencasts and if they like the free ones, they will sponsor me (at $14/mo.) to get access.\\n\\n> All of this works because I spent years and years honing my craft and producing software that is truly useful.\\n\\nThere is just no way around this. You have to learn and gain experience!\\n\\n> The work people are sponsoring for has to be quality and remain the #1 priority.\\n\\n> Building an audience is ESSENTIAL for any of this to work. Twitter followers and email subscribers are your most valuable asset\\n\\n> The biggest mistake people make with GitHub sponsors is offering too small of a first tier.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 😁️ Person of the Week\\n\\n<img style=\"border-radius: 50%; width: 100px\" src=\"https://assets.website-files.com/54a5a40be53a05f34703dd18/5d06b2e06a9360315d96c97e_Julian%20Drawn%20Small.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Shapiro\">\\n\\n[Julian Shapiro](https://www.julian.com/)\\n\\nI heard a few times Julian compared to [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/). I don\\'t think this is very fair. They both have fantastic writing skills and fantastic content on their sites. It\\'s a shame I only discovered Julian\\'s writings just now.\\n\\nThis clearly doesn\\'t show the whole range and depth of Julian\\'s work, but one quote I discovered from his post on [Building the Writing Habit](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/practice-writing) has stuck with me.\\n\\n> What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you.\\n\\n> *Carl Sagan*\\n\\n---\\n\\n## *🐔 Tweet of the week*\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/dvassallo/status/1287210142459547648\\n\\nDaniel has been producing great works and content recently.

I know most of you don\\'t care that much, but still, I should have at least sent a small update.\\n\\nThe truth is the last couple of weeks were hard. I am sure it can be attributed the prolonged quarantine, at least partially. I haven\\'t worked much on my current projects, neither did I write much. I was, however, able to move one of my projects from DigitalOcean to Heroku. More on that, later.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy this week\\'s \"Tuesday Letter\" :)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📜 Quote of the week\\n\\n> ...most founders consider using only traction channels with which they’re already familiar, or those they think they should be using because of their type of product or company. This means that far too many startups focus on the same channels and ignore other promising ways to get traction.\\n\\n> _[Traction](https://amzn.to/309SrvQ) by [Gabriel Weinberg](https://ye.gg/)_\\n\\nEven though this is observation talks about startapps, I\\'d say this also applies to humans. Simply put, we are scared of what we don\\'t know. It is crucial to try new things, to go out of the comfort zone, especially when the stakes are low (which is most of the time for people in the 21st century.)\\n\\nI love this book. There is a lot of useful information in here. In fact, my friend and I decided to try using this book for the first episode of a podcast where we talk about books / articles we read. Hopefully we can get to recording soon. Stay tuned.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🛠️ Personal Projects\\n\\nI have been working on a small side project to learn web scarping, programmatic email sending and backround tasks. I called it [Tolstoy Newsletter](https://tolstoy-newsletter.herokuapp.com/). \\n\\nLeo Tolstoy had a calendar with wisdom quotes from all around the world. I scraped that calendar and use the database to send subscribers an email each morning with the entry from the calendar. \\n\\nAll the quotes are in Russian. So this is not of an interest to English speakers. Next step in this project will be to leverage translation API to send both Russian and English version.\\n\\nI am writing a post on building an automated newlsetter with Django.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧮 Data Analysis / Science / Visualization\\n\\nI have been doing deep dives into the world of web development on the side, to learn how to build web applications and create my own business to earn extra income.

If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world? Create two timelines—6 months and 12 months—and list up to five things you dream of having (including, but not limited to, material wants: house, car, clothing, etc.), being (be a great cook, be fluent in Chinese, etc.), and doing (visiting Thailand, tracing your roots overseas, racing ostriches, etc.) in that order.\\n\\n> First, let’s focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps for each dream that will get you closer to its actualization. Set actions—simple, well-defined actions—for now, tomorrow (complete before 11 A.M.) and the day after (again completed before 11 A.M.)\\n\\n> [*The 4-Hour Workweek*](https://amzn.to/3hlCCJp) *by* [*Tim Ferriss*](https://tim.blog/)\\n\\nThis is a classic. I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ve quoted it before. I got these quotes in my Readwise email this week. They were so crucial to shaking me up and getting myself back in the game. I found that making lists, as Tim mentioned in the book, is very motivational for me. I have been very unproductive and down recently. Making a few simple lists of things I want gave me a good motivation to continue working and, more importantly, prioritizing the work I do.\\n\\nI think I am starting to understand one more thing that kept me down over the last few weeks—that thing is habit tracking. Any of you had a feeling you are tired of keeping up with those things? It is not 100% confirmed, but I think without those, life is much simpler. I have removed all time and habit trackers from my life for some time and want to see how this goes. I will surely report back to you on how this experiment went. For now, I will focus on doing things that feel right at the moment.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🛠️ Personal Projects\\n\\nThanks to [Cory Zue](https://www.coryzue.com/), I was finally able to implement Stripe payments on my website. Not only does that mean I can finally accept payments in my projects. That also means that I have increased my understanding of Django, Javascript, and how they interact with each other.\\n\\nFurthermore, I finally got a grasp on how Webpack works. This was hard and confusing, but I managed to do this. I will be writing a post on how to implement Django, Tailwind, Stimulusjs (or Vue), using webpack. Hopefully, people will find this useful.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🖼️ Web Design & Software Engineering\\n\\n* [Web Design Museum](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/) - Discover Forgotten Trends in Web Design.

We ended up solving all the problems.

There has never been a better time with more opportunities, more openings, lower barriers, higher benefit/risk ratios, better returns, greater upside than now. Right now, this minute. **This is the moment that folks in the future will look back at and say, “Oh, to have been alive and well back then!”** The last 30 years has created a marvelous starting point, a solid platform to build truly great things. But what’s coming will be different, beyond, and other. The things we will make will be constantly, relentlessly becoming something else. And the coolest stuff of all has not been invented yet.

But am very grateful for the positivity despite the coronavirus changing everyones life.\\n\\n\\n## 📜 This Week\\'s Quote from my [Readwise](https://readwise.io)\\n\\n> Stoics would recommend, for example, that I concern myself with whether my wife loves me, even though this is something over which I have some but not complete control. But when I do concern myself with this, my goal should not be the external goal of making her love me; no matter how hard I try, I could fail to achieve this goal and would as a result be quite upset. Instead, my goal should be an internal goal: to behave, to the best of my ability, in a lovable manner. Similarly, my goal with respect to my boss should be to do my job to the best of my ability.\\n\\nIt is crucial to focus on goals that are your under control. That way we can be sure we\\'ve done what we could when reviewing the result. \\n\\n**[A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy](https://amzn.to/2X5yiXx)** by William B.

       "  'body': 'Happy Wednesday!\\n\\nThis is the second issue of my personal newsletter. I was planning to send this yesterday. I even thougth of a name I am pretty happy about. Unfortunately, my mind got distracted by work and a couple of other things, so I was not able to send the second issue of \"Tuesday Letter\". Making a promise to you and myself that I will send the third version of the Tuesday Letter on Tuesday next week! \\n\\nWhat do you think of the name?\\n\\nAlso, if you have a minute, could you share a sentence or two about the last issue you received a week ago?\\n\\nThat\\'s it. Hope you enjoy this week\\'s \"Tuesday Letter\" :)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🙏 Gratitude\\n\\nUnfortunately, no new subscribers this week. But am very grateful for the positivity despite the coronavirus changing everyones life.\\n\\n\\n## 🛠️This Week\\'s Projects\\n\\n### Built with Django\\n\\n* Last week on Thursday recorded an interview with [Cody](https://twitter.com/cdyingrm) from [Armory Gaming Gear](https://armorygaminggear.com/). \\n* Recorder intro for the first interview and an actual intro episode. \\n* Otherwise, the rest of the goals are the same.\\n\\n### Course\\n\\nI got contacted by Nate from Newline about a potential course on Django. I am currently working on an Outline for \"Build a SaaS app with Django\". Very exciting. \\n\\nIf you have any suggestions as to what should be covered in the course, shoot me an [email](mailto:me@rasulkireev.com).\\n\\n### Personal Website\\n* Working on a [Digital Garden](https://rasulkireev.com/digital-garden).\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📜 This Week\\'s Quote from my [Readwise](https://readwise.io)\\n\\n> Ultimately, it comes down to the following five decisions: \\n\\t> 1. Don’t confuse what you wish were true with what is really true. \\n\\t> 2. Don’t worry about looking good—worry instead about achieving your goals.\\n\\t> 3. Don’t overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones. \\n\\t> 4. Don’t let pain stand in the way of progress. \\n\\t> 5. Don’t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.\\n\\n**[Principles](https://amzn.to/2yp2svm)** by Ray Dalio\\n\\nIf you want to receive my Readwise quotes daily, you can sign up [here](https://readwise.io/@rasul).

This was actually her first post, so her site is pretty new. Since then she posted a few other Django related posts. Very well written.\\n\\nHer areas of expertise are Python, Django, Vue.js and AWS.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 🧠 Things I Learnt This Week\\n\\n> At Amazon, Jeff Bezos asks executives to write and read six-page memos before a meeting so everyone is on the page.

This I creases trust and lowers time consumed in running companies.\\n* Book Recommendation: [Principles](https://amzn.to/2yp2svm) and [EMyth](https://amzn.to/3g7OIWO) for delegation and system of offloading tasks.\\n* Job boards are great business for niche, high engaging communities.\\n* For making profitable podcast, do the following:\\n\\t* Monthly ama (20-30 questions)\\n\\t* Extended interview from a Titan. First half free, Second for paid users.\\n\\t* For someone cool ask 5-10 questions like \"Best book in the last year\", or \"Daily Habit noone knows about\" and show results in private feeds only.\\n \\n### [My First Million: Q&A with Andrew Wilkinson, Co-founder of Tiny](https://pqqodcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/65-q-a-with-andrew-wilkinson-co-founder-of-tiny/id1469759170?i=1000471513171)\\n* Reading / Listening recommendation: read and listen to Warren Buffett\\'s and Charlie Munger\\'s writings and speeches.

Before I publish the podcast I need to:\\n* Edit two more episodes\\n* Record an intro epidose\\n* Record intros for the first three guests.\\n\\nHopefully I get this done by the next letter :)\\n\\n### The Shop for Dev\\n\\nI had to put this site on pause to focus on my other projects. I posted this site to a bunch of communities and got a wonderful response. I realised I will have to put in a lot of work to make it work. Unfortunately, I don\\'t have much time for this right now.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 📜 Quotes\\n\\n> Never forget: This very moment, we can change our lives. There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny. This second, we can turn the tables on Resistance.

That doesn’t mean you can’t tweet about anything else. It just means these are your main topics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> IF the tweet does well, add a tweet to at (create a thread) and link to your website.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> When people visit your profile they check your header, profile pic and bio. The next thing they do, if they haven’t already left or followed you, scrolls down your timeline to check what you’re writing about. Make sure it’s not all about you and what you ate for breakfast.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> The basic rule is: always talk about them. I don’t have statistics on this but if YOU mention the word YOU in your tweet, chances are a lot bigger you’ll get more engagement while saying almost the same. They read you and think (he's talking about) me.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> Don’t be blown away but you should be commenting about 10x - 15x a day on other people's timelines vs only tweeting 2 - 3x a day on your own to start with.\\n\\nHaha, that's too much.

Perhaps most of all, you want to be around people who don’t make you feel stupid for mentioning a bad idea, and who certainly never feel stupid for doing so themselves.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> Another way to do this is to think about the most important tectonic shifts happening right now. How is the world changing in fundamental ways? Can you identify a leading edge of change and an opportunity that it unlocks? The mobile phone explosion from 2008-2012 is the most recent significant example of this—we are overdue for another!\\n\\n---\\n\\n> Finally, a good test for an idea is if you can articulate why most people think it’s a bad idea, but you understand what makes it good.\\n\\nA lot of arguments in this post seem great and make sense. However one thing I am missing are basic examples. It just would be so much more if Sam mentioned an idea where most people think it's bad but he knows it's good. \\n\\n---\",\n",

The use them to predict the future.\\n\\nContribute original insights to a field through your research and experimentation.\\n\\nDistill an overwhelming topic into something approachable.\\n\\nShare a solution to a tough problem.\\n\\nTell a suspenseful and emotional story that imparts a lesson.\\n\\nMotivations\\n\\nDoes writing this article get a weight off your chest?\\n\\nDoes it help you reason through a nagging, unsolved problem of yours?\\n\\nDoes it persuade others to do something you believe is critically important?\\n\\nDo you obsess over the topic and want others to geek out on it too?\\n\\nIntroductions\\n\\nStart your brainstorming process by prematurely writing your intro. In discovering how to make your intro interesting to you, you\\'ll also discover how to interest and hook readers.\\n\\nHooks are half-told stories. Tease something fascinating, but don’t fully reveal the details.\\n\\nHow to generate hooks: (1)\\xa0Ask yourself, “If someone else wrote my intro, what are the most captivating questions they could pose to make me excited to read this?” (2)\\xa0Write those questions down. Even if you lack the answers. (3)\\xa0Rank your questions by how much they interest you. (4)\\xa0The top questions become your hooks: Pose them in your intro and don\\'t reveal their answers.\\n\\nAsk others for feedback after you\\'ve written your intro. Sanity check your hooks.\\n\\nIf feedback-givers have skepticisms, proactively address them in your intro. And if they have other questions they care about, swap them in if they captivate you too.\\n\\nBrowse the list of skepticisms and their solutions\\xa0here.\\n\\nFirst draft steps\\n\\nChoose an objective for your post.\\n\\nWrite a messy braindump of your ideas.\\n\\nTransfer your best talking points to an outline. Use supporting points and resulting points: what is needed to make your argument, and what are the implications of your argument being true?\\n\\nWrite your first draft using that outline.\\n\\nFirst draft writing process\\n\\nYour talking points come from hooks, experience, research, experiments, brainstorming, and mental models.\\n\\nWhen ideas stop flowing, ask yourself: How can I make my point more convincing? What are the interesting implications of what I just said?\\n\\nBe self-indulgent. You are a proxy for your reader. What interests and surprises you will interest and surprise them.\\n\\nTo generate surprise, use Graham’s Method: First, learn all the basics on a topic. Then, if you can find new information that surprises even your knowledgeable self, it’ll surprise laypeople too.\\n\\nOutros should frame why your article was worth reading. Share a poignant takeaway that summarizes the article\\'s wisdom, and tell readers where they can go to continue the journey they started with you.\\n\\nClarity\\n\\nIf you imagine you\\'re writing for an audience of thirteen-year-olds, you\\'ll think and write more clearly.\\n\\nUse simple wording and focus on one idea per sentence. Remove grammatical overhead.\\n\\nProvide examples and counterexamples when simplified language isn’t enough to achieve clarity.\\n\\nSuccinctness\\n\\nRewrite sections from memory. Focus on the key points and let the fluff fall away.\\n\\nThen remove unnecessary words from each paragraph.\\n\\nThen rephrase paragraphs to be as succinct as possible.\\n\\nIntrigue\\n\\nThe trifecta of intrigue: 1. A captivating intro. 2. A section of intense surprise or insight. 3. An ending that satisfyingly justifies why the piece was worth reading.\\n\\nAsk feedback-givers to highlight every sentence that gives them a dopamine hit — the little moments of \"that was interesting.\" For each hit, increase a counter at the end of the corresponding sentence. Like this (3). If there are sections without dopamine hits, make those sections shorter or inject more insight and surprise into them.\\n\\nFeedback\\n\\nAsk readers to score your writing from 1 to 10. Aim for 7.5+.\\n\\nUse your future self as a source of feedback. Take breaks to defamiliarize yourself.\\n\\nStyle\\n\\nAn authentic voice resonates best with readers: your way of speaking, interests, and perspectives on the world are a breath of fresh air.\\n\\nShed the style you’ve absorbed from others. Write nonfiction the way you sound.\\n\\nOptionally incorporate multimedia, anecdotes, analogies, and humor to reinforce your points and to entertain.\\n\\nCopyediting\\n\\nOptionally learn to punctuate with my\\xa0companion post.\\n\\nUse paragraphs of five sentences or fewer. This cushions paragraphs with white space, reducing the perceived reading workload. Short paragraphs also provide readers more opportunities to pause and reflect on your ideas.\\n\\nUse verbs that embed the meaning of their adverbs. For example, “She spoke loudly” could be “She shouted.”\\n\\nOnly use adjectives and adverbs if they add important details.\\n\\nPractice\\n\\nPractice by writing persuasive essays. This helps you focus on improving (A) the quality of your thinking and (B) your eye for rewriting. Try writing posts that persuade your friends to change their minds.\\n\\nAsk them to score how much your writing sustained their interest.\\n\\nKeep learning\\n\\nRead my other\\xa0in-depth guides\\xa0and\\xa0blog posts.\\n\\nSay hello on\\xa0Twitter.\\n\\nYou are receiving this email because you opted in on Julian.com.\\n\\nOur mailing address is:\\n\\nJulian Shapiro\\n\\nSan Francisco\\n\\nSan Francisco,\\xa0CA\\xa094110\\n\\n\\nAdd us to your address book\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can\\xa0update your preferences\\xa0or\\xa0unsubscribe from this list.￼\\n\\n\\n',\n",

You're free to decline bad offers and hold out for what you think the project is worth, or take the deal if it's close enough.\\n\\n> No-code projects surprisingly can fetch a higher price than code projects because no-code projects have a larger potential market of acquirers. To sell a code project the buyer has to be able to program themselves (in the same languages you used) or have the money to hire someone who can. That narrows down how many people can buy your side project.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': '07/23/2020\\n\\nhttps://www.nateliason.com/blog/start-a-blog\\n\\nBelow is the list of things that jumped at me the first time I was reading this piece. However, I encourage to read the whole thing. It is fascinating, and is full of useful and actionable advice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> Way too many people obsess over launching with a perfect site and never go live. \\n\\nYep, I can certainly relate to that. I did go live multiple times, but I spent hours and hours making sure each pixel looks good. It was a total waste of time, since you won\\'t be ever fully satisfied with the design. I changed it up at least 5 time.\\n\\nOne upside, I learnt a good portion of HTML and CSS. \\n\\n---\\n\\n> Get over the fear and put yourself out there.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What to Write About\\n\\n> That\\'s a combination of good SEO, and good curation. People don\\'t want to read 10 articles or 30 guides. They want one great resource. Your job is to create a great resource for whatever you\\'re writing about.\\n\\n## Finding Topics to Write About\\n\\n> If you write an \"I believe\" post and you don\\'t piss some people off, you\\'re not doing it right.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Surge Traffic\\n\\n> Reddit has so many people on it, and there are communities for everything. Whenever I published a post I thought would do well there, I would find a community I could share it in, post it, and see what happened.\\n\\nMost of the time, it didn\\'t work. It wouldn\\'t catch on and wouldn\\'t drive any significant visitors. But sometimes it did, and it would work in a big way.\\n\\n---\\n\\n> So what\\'s the secret to getting a big spike of traffic from reddit? Unfortunately it\\'s a fairly dull strategy: write a great article, find a good community to share it in, post it, maybe cheat a little bit by having 3-4 extra reddit accounts upvote it, and cross your fingers. It won\\'t work most of the time, but when it does, it can be a game changer.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Evergreen traffic\\n\\n> you don\\'t want to waste your time by producing pieces that are only valuable for a few days.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Audience Traffic\\n\\n> This is the ultimate goal for any blog. You want to build up a base of people who love what you write, and who will consider reading anything new you put out. It\\'s where the true value of the blog comes in, because it means you\\'re on people\\'s minds for certain kinds of opportunities or questions they might encounter.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t take long to convert me into such person. I think after reading 2-3 posts I was hooked on Nat\\'s writing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Monetization and Spotting Opportunities\\n\\n> If we remove the Roam Course, here\\'s what my revenue for this site looks like since 2018.\\n\\n![4ad971fabff8fa4f906a68171a1e2b43.png](:/e7b385df259a4f95a28f6f032420949f)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Affiliate Sales\\n\\n> For this site, the affiliate income has been nice, but it\\'s not massive, and not something I intend to optimize around. Treat affiliate income for a personal site as bonus money.\\n\\n',\n",

So here is he working version:\\n\\n```graphql\\n<page-query>\\nquery Post ($path: String!) {\\n  post: post (path: $path) {\\n    title\\n    date (format: \"MMMM D, Y\")\\n    content\\n    path\\n  }\\n  mentions: allWebMention (filter: { wmTarget: { regex: $path } }) {\\n    totalCount\\n    edges {\\n      node {\\n        wmId\\n        wmProperty\\n        content {\\n          text\\n        }\\n        author {\\n          name\\n        }\\n      }\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n</page-query>\\n```\\n\\nThen you can access these queries like this:\\n\\n```html\\n<div>{{ $page.post.title }}</div>\\n\\n<div \\nv-for=\"mention in wmArray.edges\"\\n:key=\"mention.node.wmId\"\\n>\\n\\t<p>{{ mention.node.wmProperty }}</p>\\n\\t<p>{{ mention.node.content.text }}</p>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '**Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague.** I made this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.\\n\\nAs Voltaire once wrote, ==**\"The best is the enemy of the good.\"**==\\n\\nThe most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior. \\n**Openness to experience**: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. \\n**Conscientiousness**: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. \\n**Extroversion**: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts). \\n**Agreeableness**: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. \\n**Neuroticism**: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.',\n",

Freedom (Financial, Location) - that's a big one\\n2. Low Stress\\n3. Great relationship with my wife (+ other family members)\\n4. Having friends to hang out with\\n5. Health\\n6. Physical Appearance\\n7. Time for hobbies (things I enjoy)\\n8. Always learning something new \\n9. Home in the suburbs (garden)\\n10. Meaningful work\\n\\nDreamlines (idea form [The 4-Hour Workweek - 2018/12/09](:/2cf4b1010e6a49159d28c02c744f9ce9) by [Tim Ferriss](:/e320dedd21c54a20bf30cf251157518e)):\\n\\nList up to 5 goals (having, being, doing)/\\n\\n6 month dreamline:\\n\\n1. Buy a car\\n2. Vacation to Maldives\\n3. Be very fit\\n4. Vacation back at home\\n5. Own a profit bearing business\\n\\n12 month dreamline:\\n\\n1. Move to Europe (Switzerland)\\n2. Buy an apartmet / house\\n3. have a dog\\n4. start child process\\n5.  ---\\n\\n---\\n\\nIt looks as though making this list has motivated me to do something (just a little bit). Just did some pull ups and push ups. Ever since I did te first day of the 100 pushup challenge I was not able to do pushups well... Can bearly do 5 proper one... I'm not sure if I somehow damaged my muscls or something like that. Furthermore, trying to do pull ups I realized how out of shape I've become. This is all becaue I don't do exercise in the morning, which happens because I don't wake up in the morning, which happens becuase I don't go to bed early enough, which happens because during quarantine I have a feeling that I'll have time for everything, which is clearly not true.\\n\\nI do less work during the day, finish working late, have less time to spend with my wife, less time to work on my projects, less time in relaxing. I'd say that my fears of not havung enough time are warranted, but it is not beciase I am so importnatn or so busy, just becuase I lack the discipline.\\n\\nI don't mean to make it sound like I am a failure at everything. There are clearl a lot of good things. For one, I was finally able to make stripe api work on my Django site!! Hoorray!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': \"07/16/2020\\n\\nhttps://www.t3.com/us/features/best-non-stick-frying-pan\\n\\nHow can I make non-stick pans last longer?\\n\\nSimple: don't clean them in a dishwasher, and don't subject them to extreme heat – ie: above 180º in the oven, or on your hottest burner at full whack. That's true whether you're using induction, gas or ceramic. \\n\\nNon-stick pans are really designed for use on low to moderate heat. The best ones conduct heat so well that this is all they need. You can turn the heat right up for short periods to sear meat, but for maximum longevity, don't do this for more than a minute or so. Use a cast iron pan instead if you're into ultra-manly, mega-heat-based cooking.\\n\\nA happy side effect of cooking on a slightly lower heat is that cleaning is much easier, so you can do it by hand. With more expensive pans you can practically get away with a quick wipe with a tea towel after some meals.\\n\\nOh, and for god's sake, don't turn up the burner so flame (or the edges of a halogen hob) extend beyond the base of the pan. That's like farting in a lift. With an induction hob, you can't heat beyond the edge of a pan, so they're fully safe in that respect.\",\n",

Don\\'t know how to exlpain the unmotivatedness to be honest. I think I should write to the authors chanell in slack for the newline authors. Proably should consult more with various communities. I do find it somewhat onligatory when I start. It goes lik this. I wite a post, not only do I feel onligated to reply to each response, but if people start responding I feel I kind of have to respond to other peoples questions. It sounds horrible. I do love responding when I want to. It feel great to be helpful, but this feeling of requirement just kills all the joy. (Could write a small post about this).\\n\\nActually this brings me to another point. I do have this tendency to hate obligatory things. Valentines Day flowers, hate them. This is just one example that comes to mind. There are many more. But the sole fact of this hate of obligatory things is not healthy. Yes, sometimes when the thing is useless and just a waste of time it is totally ok to skip it. But most of the time, there is a reason for the obligation. As with Valenties day, it is only there toremind people to say those three words and find the time to be romantic. It is a reminder , not on obligation. \\n\\nThese obligations kind of remind me of a routine. Roughly two years ago I started making kombucha, first it was fun, exciting, delicious. After some time it became an obligation. If I didn\\'t do it, it would die and I would have to start over again. My kombucha is still alive, but I don\\'t make it, ever. Tahnk goodness it holds well over long peeriods of time, as opposed to more delicate organisms as sourdough, kefir and plants. Adding more and more hobbies is fun. It is important to try and experiment with new things, but it is also important not to over do with those hobbies as they can eat up all your time, family time, rest time, work time... There is a whole life ahead, and I will have time to try many many different things. Now though, and on a daily basis I should be doing some ort of a reality check, which will tell me if I am doing the right things, aligned with my goals.\\n\\nAn action point for the few paragraphs above is that I should schedule some time each day to think through what is important. It is another obligation, but it is an important one. Perhaps i should not be done every day, but rather each week. Something like, what would you like to accomplish. Waht have you acomplished....\\n\\nIt is ok to write in this journal. It would also be ok to create another journal just for this person. Checkin. \\n\\nWow. This has been many words. I wonder if it is better to write in this journal each day or with some breaks. Should it be sceduled, or on a whim, like right now? even though I did not plan for today\\'s entry, it is a fruitfull one. Very fruitfull indeed.\\n[00:08]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Хотел сказать невыносима, но это пожалуй слишком сильное слово, но если честно я не очень далек от этого. \\n\\nСегодня будильник ставил на 7:30, в итоге проснулся в 8:13. Пока сделал кофе, помедитировал, прошелся по имейлу и пару другим сервисам уже наступило 9:00... Как же с жтим быть? Как быстро идет время. Только что, добавил пару заданий в календарь на день.\\n\\nВчера, ответил на комментарии бета пользователей по поводу курса. Мне кажется в общем и в целом для начала иду по хорошей траектории. Сейчас самым главным является записать первый урок. 10 мин макс! В будущем записи будут более тяжелые поэтому это очень важно входить в ритм записи!\\n\\nЧто касается подкаста, то так как говорить мне ничего не надо, то это не обязательно делать ранним утром. Надо найти идельное время для этого. Во время или после работы? Не уверен.\\n',\n",

While it’s possible to stumble into an initial core loop that works, the companies that are successful in the long term are the ones that can repeatedly find the next loop. However, this evolution is poorly understood relative to its existential impact on a company’s trajectory. Figma is a prime example of sequencing loops. They’re now widely viewed as successful, but the key factors in their success and what bets they must make to get to the next level are less widely understood.\\n\\n> Good post to reference as a reason to switch to Figma.\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '[Learning operating system development using Linux kernel and Raspberry Pi](https://s-matyukevich.github.io/raspberry-pi-os/)\\n\\nThis repository contains a step-by-step guide that teaches how to create a simple operating system (OS) kernel from scratch. I call this OS Raspberry Pi OS or just RPi OS. The RPi OS source code is largely based on Linux kernel, but the OS has very limited functionality and supports only Raspberry PI 3.\\n\\nEach lesson is designed in such a way that it first explains how some kernel feature is implemented in the RPi OS, and then it tries to demonstrate how the same functionality works in the Linux kernel. Each lesson has a corresponding folder in the src directory, which contains a snapshot of the OS source code at the time when the lesson had just been completed. This allows the introduction of new concepts gracefully and helps readers to follow the evolution of the RPi OS. Understanding this guide doesn’t require any specific OS development skills.\\n\\nFor more information about project goals and history, please read the Introduction. The project is still under active development, if you are willing to participate - please read the Contribution guide.',\n",

Как было подмечено вчера буду старать делать это регулярно, как минимум раз в день. В идеале 2-3 раза.\\n\\nДумаю что не успеваю заняться крупным проектам жти утром, так сейчас может немного потуплю, немного от фильтрую NAS, проверю HN и PH. В общем, немного тупняка. Сегодня буду готовить Newsletter. Также хотел у Алана попросить какой нибудь новый проект. Будет тяжело, но думаю это правильное решение.\\n\\nСейчас в голову пришла идея посмотреть скоьлко может стоить поддержанная машина в которой можно спать, очень интересно. \\n\\nХорошего дня!',\n",

Почему бы не постораться жти цели реализовывать сейчас. \\n\\nОчень хороший вопрос. Хотел бы над этим думать чаще. Таня например, записалась на уроки танце и шитья. Также взяла бы тренера для тренировок. Я бы в свою очередь хотел бы иметь дом в котором был бы свой сад как идельное место для спокойствия и релаксации. Я бы хотел создавать проекты, делать / учиться разным навыкам, в зависимости от текущего состояния. Также мы оба сошлись на путеществиях. Хорошие цели как по мне. в общем показывают наше стремление к обучению и улучшению. \\n\\nС моей стороны, мои цели вполне достижимы! Для спокойствия и релаксации всегда есть медитация. Нужно делать ее регулярно. 2-3 раза в день. Изучать и пробовать разные и интересные рецепты (мой второй мозг отличное место для этого). Что касается путешествий, можно начать с изучения США. Для этого нужна машина. Если полностью взять финансы в свои руки, чисто теоритически можно приобрести машину. Более того, проекты над которыми я сейчас работаю, помимо работы, должны с этим помочь. Что касается новых проектов, то на работе у меня есть возможность изучать много всего нового!',\n",

С каждой неделей будем все дальше и двльше выходить. Но вот сейчас думаю... А нахрена? Вот около нас есть ххорощий парк. Затем мне собирать тонну вещей и ехать час в нью йорк, когда погулять и полежать можно возле дома? Чем так волшебен этот Нью Йорк? Не знаю. Однозначно не зочу здесь всю жизнь жить.\\n\\n# Работа\\nНичего дельного с работой связаного так и не сделал вчера. Сегодня хочу чуть чуть поредачить интро эпизод и эпизод первый. И еще записать как я настраиваю проект для курса. В принципе все. Также нужно будет (возможно сейчас) побриться, помыть сковородку и приготовить чечевицу нв неделю вперед.\\n\\n# Проекты\\nВ последнее ывремя очень много идей для разных проектов в голову приходит. Прикольные идеи кстати. Но появляется какой то парализ, страх что не получиться или что и так много всего. И возможно последнее это правда кстати. Нет бесконечного времени сейчас и поэтому нужно регулярно переосмысливать текущие проекты. Например сейчас, производство видео курса для Newline очень хорошая идея, и с точки зрения скиллов и знакомств. Так что нужно зорошее количество сил и времнени потартить именно на это. Что касается подкаста, то да, это может и занимает много времени, но если все наладить хорошо, то и не так уж и много. Главное не брать на себя сликом много. Редактировать один эпизод за раз (это два часа). Главное его опубликовать. Добавлять по одному проекту за день. Это 15 - 30 минут, включая твиттер и тому подобное.\\n\\n# Знакомства\\nВчера во время прогулки, обсудили что нужно больше знакомых. Со своей стороны сказал что напишу в свои чаты с вопросом о том, есть ли пары проживающие в Нью Йорке / Ньюарке? Иногда меня раздражает не самостоятельность Тани если честно. \\n\\n> Таня если ты это читаешь, не обижайся, я тебя сильно люблю :)\\n\\nХотелось бы чтобы она более самодостаточно, и думаю знакоства не помещали бы. Иногда мне нужно побыть одному и не обязательно чтобы поработать, а чятобы поутпит, отдахнуть. Короче не огромные проюлемы, но просто идеи для развития. Идея кстати, написать в чаты о том что хотим сЪездить в Ithaca на день - два и ищем с кем бы это сделать.',\n",

I don't want to go into a deep discussion on what happened and what we did during those days...\\n\\nWell, ok. One big thing is that we rented a car couple of days ago and went to a beach, Wildwood State Park. We made a couple of stopson the way there, Brighton Beach, Optimum and Microcenter, and arrived at the beach around 2 pm. Left around 7pm and on the way back we visited Trader Joe's, Costco and Georgian Restaurant and ate in Dumbo with a NYC view. Nice. The trip ended up being very good. \\n\\n> One lesson I learnt during the card trip that in the relationship it is extremely cruacial to let your prtner know what you want! In my example it was the music. I started of whining about the fact that Tanya played music I did not like... Nothing changed. But on the way back, instead I asked for specific music and she had no problem turning it on. :)\\n\\nLast weekend I set up our home NAS (Network Attached Storage). I was too scared to actually do it at first. It seemed very complicated. I read a ton of posts about it and they seemed to overcomplicate things, or rather I seemed to get confused by various techologies and terminology. For instance, I thought that the only way to set up a NAS was to use Nextcloud, FreeNAS or something similar. In the end it turned out to be much, much simpler. \\n\\n1) Connect Raspberry PI to your Network\\n2) Attach hard drives\\n3) Install & Configure Samba\\n\\nThat's it. I certainly need to write a post about it.\\n\\n\",\n",

A logbook isn’t necessarily a diary or a journal, it’s just a little book in which you list the things you do every day. What project you worked on, where you went to lunch, what movie you saw. It’s much easier than keeping a detailed diary, and you’d be amazed at how helpful having a daily record like this can be, especially over several years. The small details will help you remember the big details.',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n[10:15]\\nСходу хочу сказать что выходные нужно проводить чуть более структурировано. Если оставлять их на самотек, они проходят быстро, незаметно, и зачастую бесполезно. Структура это не что-то что можно сделать один раз и все будет поправлено, это важная работа которая требует постоянного наблюдения, поправок и контроля. Если это принять как данность, то возможно отношение и результат изменяться.\\n\\nВчера с Таней был романтический ужин. Я сделал пасту с морепродуктами, зажег свечи. Мы покушали, немного выпили и потанцевали, потом занимались любовью. Очень хороший вечер.\\n\\nВот уже которую неделю немогу утром нормально проснуться. Возможно правильнее будет сказать, не могу вовремя заснуть. Опять же отсутствие дисциплины. У нас в семье, выходные это время когда все забывается и время для самого натсоящего разлагания. Мы забываем про работу, диеты, задачи, таблети, все, все, все. Чисто теоритически это может быть хорошей идеей, но только если это было сделано раздумано. К сожалению чаще всего это не так.\\n\\nЧто касается о осознание того что структура и продуктивность и работа которая должна продолжаться постоянно и с этим надо смириться, аналогично могу сказать тоже самое про работу в GC. Порой я на нее смотреб как на нечто обязательное и глупое, то что не дает мне заниматься своими проектами. Ну, отчасти это так и есть, но если подумать, то по сути моя работа это возможность учить новые вещи и делать проекты. Как в свое время мне сказал Дэн Ариели, вместо того чтобы искать работу с определенными характеристиками, возьми и создай эти характеристи сам. Очень хороший совет. На своей работе я однозначно увеличу свои знания питона (это раз), знания SQL (это два), Spark, Cloud Computing, Databases. Это уже достаточно потрясающий список. Думаю некоторый аспекты работы такие как работа с брокерами, продолжительная работа на Market Toolkit, немного давят на отсутствие разнообразия. Более того это может не совсем то что я хотел делать, тут надо вспомнить что ничего идеальным не бывает и может сделать все что захотим из того что у нас есть. В это случае я могу себя полностью отдать проекту поскорее его закончив и преступить к следующим задачам и проектам.\\n\\nЧто касается проектов на стороне, раз в день было бы неплохо думать: \"Делаю ли я правильные вещи? Над теми ли проектами ли я работаю?\" Такой вопрос будет направлять меня в нужную сторону. Нет ничего стращного в призанние неудачности проекта и дальнего движения вперед, оставив удачу позади сделав некоторые уроки.\\n\\nСейчас думаю не буду делать этот самоанализ, но было бы неплохо сегодня об этом подумать и сделать.',\n",

       "  'body': 'Let\\'s say you want to add an external library to your Gridsome website. In my case I really wanted to add [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) to my website.\\n\\n> Hypothes.is tries to enable a conversation over the world’s knowledge. In Layman\\'s terms it allows users to comment, highlight and annotate content on any site. Adding it to my site I will help people explore this tool and will hopefully drive more conversation about my posts.\\n\\n**TL;DR**\\nAdd script tags to your site via `mounted` function.\\n```\\nexport default {\\n  mounted() {\\n        let hypothesisScript = document.createElement(\"script\")\\n        hypothesisScript.setAttribute(\\'src\\', \\'https://hypothes.is/embed.js\\')\\n        document.body.appendChild(hypothesisScript)\\n  },\\n...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI can add hypothes.is to my site just by adding the following script tag to my index.html, right above the closing body tag.\\n\\n```\\n<script src=\"https://hypothes.is/embed.js\" async></script>\\n```\\nThis will add the hypothesis sidebar to all my pages. This can be a good enough solution. However I don\\'t want to crowd each page on my site with this sidebar. Well then, how can I add it to specific Pages only?\\n\\nGiven Gridsome\\'s structure it is very easy to isolate specific pages. For example, we could target `Post.vue` if I only want this script in articles. Or I could target `About.vue` if I wanted to add to about apge only.\\n\\n```\\n├── content\\n|  ├── articles\\n|  ├── notes\\n|  ├── now\\n├── gridsome.config.js\\n├── gridsome.server.js\\n├── src\\n|  ├── components\\n|  |  └── socialShareButtons.vue\\n|  ├── index.html\\n|  ├── layouts\\n|  |  ├── Default.vue\\n|  ├── main.js\\n|  ├── pages\\n|  |  ├── 404.vue\\n|  |  ├── About.vue\\n|  |  ├── Articles.vue\\n|  |  ├── Index.vue\\n|  └── templates\\n|     ├── BookNote.vue\\n|     └── Post.vue\\n```\\n\\nNow the question is: \"How do I add the script tag?\". If you added in the templates it will show up and load in the middle of the page, which is not ideal. We want this script to be right inserted right before the cloding body tag. \\n\\nWell, we can do this with a `mounted` function: \\n\\n```\\nexport default {\\n  mounted() {\\n        let hypothesisScript = document.createElement(\"script\")\\n        hypothesisScript.setAttribute(\\'src\\', \\'https://hypothes.is/embed.js\\')\\n        document.body.appendChild(hypothesisScript)\\n  },\\n...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\\'s review. \\n1. Create a variable/element called `script`\\n2. Set the src attribute to the library url\\n\\t* Note: when you add a script via a script (very meta) async tag is added automatically, so no need to worry about it\\t  \\n3. `Mount` the element to body\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nNow you have your desired extrernal library only on pages you want.

       "  'body': \"I found myself unsubscribing from a whole bunch of stupid newsletters lately.  [List the newsletters...] This has been going on for years. I always find myself receiving letters I never signed up for. This made me very careful about giving out my email on the internet.\\n\\nHowever, recently something changed and I am now addicted to subscribing to email newsletters. The thing that changed for me is that I have been much more active on Twitter and Hacker News, where developers and indiehackers are present. The reason I am more active there is because about a year ago I embarked on a journey to become an Indiehacker. My goal was to start earning cash with a Side Projects. This opened me up to a web development community and I have been learning web dev ever since (Django & Vue mainly).\\n\\nBeing active in places like Twitter and Hacker News opened me up to a lot of interesting people. Everytime I visit a personal websites and encountered at least one interesting post, I start searching for the `subscribe` button.\\n\\nIn this post I will try to explain why you should start a personal newsletter.\\n\\n\\n---**write new stuff above this line**---\\n\\nIt is not a corporation who is going to send you tons of crap. It is a person who will be sharing their latest news and their thoughts on various things. I think this is powerfull. \\n\\n> I missed that RSS era. I used Google Reader (I totally forgot what is was called) and Feedly. Only used it for news, not for personal newsletter or various feeds.\\n\\nI look forward to receiving that Monday Newsletter from Nat Eliason, or the Five Bullet Friday from TIm Ferriss. I never had that feeling with corp newsltters. \\n\\nPersonal Newsltteer will be like messaging. i.e. it is like receiving a message from a friend who let you know what he has been up to. You can ottally reply, but no need to do it right now. That's perfect.\\n\\n## Resource I like\\n* EmailOctopus\\n*\",\n",

       "  'body': '\\n[08:55 - 09:15]\\nМне сегодня сон приснился про Таню. Все детали не помню, в целом идея состояла в том что мы были на начальном этапе отношений и очень хотел нравиться Тане. Очень не зотел уезжать без нее в США, так как знал что буду скучать. Более детально помню сцены в Чигасово, где мы вроде тусили вместе с друзьями, или семьей и мы только под конец тусовки умудрлились поговорить друг с другом. Но ничего не получилось, и это было очень грустно. Потом сцена перенеслась в какой-то кинотеатр по моему. Там одна из сцен (по-моему) состояла в том что я говорю Тане, что мне надо лететь, а если она не успеет сделать визу то мне будет очень грустно.\\n\\nВозможно какие-то детали из этого сна я упустил, но в целом, смысл в том что этот сон напомнил мне о том как трепетно и внимательно я относился к нашим отношениям. Однозначно могу сказать что раньше определенные эмоции у меня выражались по другому, и сейчас они проявляются в намного более тихой форме, если вообше проявляются. Это не хорошо. Возможно это какой то глупый мужской инстинкт где утиз стимул проявлять романтические жесты. Но это очень важная часть жизни, это очень важная часть отношений. Над Этим надо работать и все у всех будет замечательно. Во что думаю я, на счет того как над этим надо работать.\\n\\n**Чаще дарить цветы и маленькие подарки**. С финансовой точки зрения в этом не ничего страшного, это может стоить где-то $25 за подарок в неделю, плюс где то час времени чтоюы найти этот подарок. Не стращная потеря, за тот return что можно получить.\\n**Устроить романтический ужин два раза в месяц**. Купить свечи доллар стор, легко. Найти рецепт и потратить на его приготовление часа два полсе работы, все... Тоже, с точки зрение инвестированного времени не большая потеря, особенно если учитывать return.\\nПробовать новые вещи / приключения. Тут может быть по тяжелее. Так как машины у нас нет, без аренды далеко не уедешь, а аренда кусается, может стоить где-то $100 в день... Хотя я так говорю, как будто это совсем ужас, но если устраивать путешествие раз в месц то очень приемлимо может выходить. Итого получается 300 долларов в месяц, а жене в сотни раз приятнее.\\n\\nЭто то над чем надо работать, однозачно. Возможно мои проблемы сексуального характера приходят в связи с тем что пропал стимул, желание и нужда во всем этом. Но не надо забывать, что то что кажется своим, может пропасть в любую секунду, в лучших традициях стоицизма. Также в жтих же тралициях нужно ставить цели над которыми имеешь полный контроль... Целью должно быть не сделать Таню счастливой, а стараться изо всех сил чтобы сделать ее счастливой.',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n[08:50]\\nДоброе утро. Вот только встал, умылся, сделал кофе и налил себе хлорофиловской водички.\\n\\nСейчас после записи уделю немного времени спредшиту по продуктивности от Nat Eliason. Думал о том что нужно заново попробовать вести Habit Tracker. Думал как это сделать, с помощью какого приложение, и в конце коцнов остановился на обысно спредшите. Вспомнил что у Нэта тоже был своего рода спредшит. Пожтому думаю с небольщой кастомизацией можно его отлично подстроить под себя.\\n\\nВчера говорил с Нэйтом из Newline насчет курса по Джанго. Хорошо поболтали. В течении разговора я чуть более скептитически стал относиться к идее того что могу сделать целый курс, но меня это не остановить. Вот сейчас думаю что на самом деле очень возможно что больщое количество производителей разных кусров сами по себе новички. Так что это не должно быть преградой.\\n\\nНа работе работаю над все тем же проектом Маркет Тулкит, но единственная разница вчерашнего дня от остальных это я знал что делаю и работал, работал, не мог остановиться. Давно у меня такого на работе не было. Более того, из-за этого я не могу уелить время изучению вью уже вот который день! Но это в целом не плохо.\\n\\n[09:22]\\nВсе, поработал над системой все выглядит очень даже неплохо. Должен сказать что эта система, как мне кажется, одновременно хрупкая и крепкая. Хрупкая она потому что требует постоянного наблюдения, и взаимотнощения с ней. Но при это и крепкая, так как только улучщается со временем, и если про нее забыдь на несколько дней или недель то ничего не произойдет. Можно просто вернуться. Некоторые системы которые я до этого пробовал делать не очень хорошо работали из-за принудительного эффекта. Казалось что стоит день пропустить и все, катастрофа. Такие мысли нужно отложить в сторону. Нв выходных более подробно спланирую и подготовлю свою платформу продуктивности на Июнь. Это в себя включает, подготовку Спредщита и Асаны. Теперь вот думаю для  сходести между платформами, сделаю Еженедельные спринты в Асане. Надесь так можно.\\n\\nЕще очень важное подмечание состоит в том что абсолютно обязательное условие продуктивности это ведение календаря. Как говорил Раян Калп, если этого нет в календаре, этого нет. Но по версии Нэта, он вставляет в календарь только необходимые вещи Всречи, Митингии, Звонки. Остальное время он посвещает заданию которое считет максимально эффектиным и которое принесет больше всего пользы.',\n",

Uncertainty\\n\\nCompares investing to lemmings jumping of a cliff. \\n\\nValuation is like a life west. It doesn’t mean you won’t make mistakes, it will just make them slower and hurt less. Gives your rational side a chance to speak. \\n\\nIn models the numbers are estimates and therefore can’t be counted on being fully objective. \\n\\nLess is more. If you can value a company with 3 parameters , don’t go looking for five. \\n\\nThere are three approaches to valuation \\n* Intrinsic Valuation (fundamentals, it’s all about the business)\\nBasically present value of all expected cash flows\\n\\n* Relative Valuation (looking at prices for similar companies)\\n* Option pricing models based on contingent cash flows. Essentially cash flows that are dependent on a certain event (fda approval, oil price going up, etc) \\n\\n\\n## Lesson 2 - Intronsic Valuation - Foundation \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Вот только что подумал (надо будет подтвердить данными), что возможно более жффективно стал работать. Точнее больше времени стал работе уделять. Из этого следует, что у меня меньше времени делать постороннии проекты, и наверное в целом это нормально. Это поможет мне лучше приотизировать.\\n\\nС этой мысли мозг сразу переходит к редактированию подкастов. Какая же эта трата времени. Хотя я сейчас представил Тим Ферриса, и думаю что эта может и не такая уж трата времени. Скорее всего Тим эпизоды не редактирует, но возможно прослушывает перед выпуском, делает какие нибудь заметки. И тут я понял что я когда редактирую, тоже параллельно делаю заметки и именно это и ханимает больщое количество времени. И это в принципе не страшно. Я могу этот материал использовать для имейл рассылки, для блога или текстового интервью. Это поможет расширить Built with Django. Но все равно, это такая боль.\\n\\nВчера с Таней смотрели третью часть миссия невыполнима. Хороший фильм. Второй день подряд ужинаем арбузом. Хотя вчера после арбуза съели еще и пирог и вареники. \\n\\nПроблемы сексуального характера продолжаются. Не уверен откуда это, так как в целом все жихни у нас хорошо и радостно. как я написал в журнале благодарности, я очень рад что мне досталась такая хамечательная жена, которую я очень сильно люблю. Хочу обнимать и целовать Таню каждый день. Не знаю, в чем проблема. \\n\\nПереживаю что мы каждый вечер смотрим телек, фильмы. Не очень люблю это делать так как чувствую что это время когда мы тупим и ничего не делаем. Иногда такое время нужно, но не каждый день. Когда мы смотрим фильм, вечер улетучивается в никуда.\\n\\nДавно уэе ничего полезного не читал. Не статьи из Pocket не книги. Сегодня скачаю эссэ Баффета в Киндл, кстати. \\n\\nПодходит Май к концу. На вызодных сделаю ревью Мая и с планирую следующие две недели. В персональных спринтах думаю попробую две недели вместо месяца. Я так подумал, одна из причин по которой я забываю многие вещи делать в течении дня, это то что задачи разделены между DevOps, Asana и Тудуист. И немсотря на то что в этом разделении есть логика, это слега затрудняет доступ к заданиям. Думаю можно будет попробовать переести все из Тудуиста в Асану. Ну или просто на данный момент продублировать все в Асане.\\n\\nИз всех срочных задач думаю самая по настоящему срочная это заполениня налоговой формы для New Jersey. Ее надо срочно заполнить и распечатать в двух экземплярах. Один отправить, другой держать пока офис не откроется.',\n",

Even though it is an officially a database, in reality it is a simple file that you can send as of it was a regular PDF. \\n\\n3. It is very quick in most SQL operations\\n\\n4.

       "  'body': '[Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) is a great invention for people who like to read, when they **want** to read. It gives you superpowers.\\n\\n### Superpower #1\\nIt allows you to save articles you encounter during the day for later. That way, you are not distracted from whatever it is you are doing at the moment. \\n\\n### Superpower #2\\nYou can make highlights in your Pocket Article. Then later review those highlights and add them to your [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/), if you have one.\\n\\n### So, what\\'s the problem?\\nNow, let\\'s say that you have signed up for a particularly useful email course, like [Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/)\\'s [How to Validate an Idea](https://gohighbrow.com/portfolio/how-to-validate-an-idea/) or a particularly insightful newsletter like [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/)\\'s [Monday Medleys](https://www.nateliason.com/join) or [Arvid Kahl](https://www.arvidkahl.de/)\\'s [Bootstrapped Founder](https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/newsletter/). How can you save it for later if you are a little busy right now? Well, that is not a problem, since that is what Email Inbox is for. \\n\\nThe other problem is making notes. Here, email is not that useful, as opposed to Pocket. Unfortunately, Pocket does not allow for saving emails, only webpages. This is weird, and it doesn\\'t seem like they are planning to add that feature any time soon.\\n\\n### Solution\\nDo not worry, though, there is an insultingly easy solution for this. [Publish this email](https://www.publishthis.email/) lets you create a web page in seconds. The service is entirely free! All you got to do is send you an email to page@publishthis.email and wait for a reply. That\\'s it. They usually reply within seconds. In that reply, you get a link to a web page with the contents of the email. Now, you can simply press \"add to pocket,\" and you are done. \\n\\nNow you have a nice centralized location for all the written words you consume during the day!',\n",

To complete this project I had to:\\n\\n* Scrape a webpage\\n* Structure the data\\n* Collect email to a database\\n* Set up a recurring job that sends an email each morning to all email in a database\\n\\nMy point is that there are a lot of skills involved in setting up this project and I am sure that you, the reader, will pick something up. At least, I try hope that you do. Not only that, but I hope that you will just enjoy reading this. Last thing I want for this piece is to be boring. \\n\\nEnjoy.\\n\\n## How I came up with the idea\\n\\nI was listening to an episode of the North Star podcast guesting James Clear. He mentioned an interesting thing that I was not aware of. Leo Tolstoy had made a Wisdom Calendar with a quote or a thought from a prolific thinker, philosopher or a writer. There was a quote for each day of the year. \\n\\nI was born and taught in Russia and was not aware of such calendar. I'm pretty sure that 90% of the population don't know that.\\n\\nI did some digging and found web page which had the whole calendar on it. I thought that it would be cool to receive one quote per day each morning from this calendar.\\n\\nThat is how the idea was born. I decided to build a newsletter that will automatically send me and other subscribers a quote from Tolstoy's Calendar, each morning forever (unless they unsubscribe, of course).\\n\\n## Research\\n\\nI ready wanted to use this project as a vehicle to learn some new technology. JavaScript Framework for example. \\n\\n> I really want to learn vue.js. for some reasons it feels cool to me. Although, to be honest, even after a lot of reading I don't understand the need for JS frameworks. \\n\\nLong story short, I did not find a viable solution to build this project, so I decided to stick with good old Django.\\n\\n> Django can do everything.\\n\\n## Building a web scraper\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': \"The Indie Hacker Guide to building a Twitter Audience\\n\\nhttps://www.indiehackers.com/post/the-indie-hacker-guide-to-building-a-twitter-audience-89d227e300\\n\\n# Step 1: Choose the topics you want to tweet about\\n\\neveryone should pick about 3 - 5 topics where they consistently tweet about.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t tweet about anything else. It just means these are your main topics.\\n\\nIF the tweet does well, add a tweet to at (create a thread) and link to your website.\\n\\nTweets with links in them get fewer impressions.\\n\\n# Step 2: Get your basics in order\\n\\nWrite a compelling bio. Why should people follow you?\\n\\nScroll down your timeline and remove all the B/S you’ve been tweeting about. \\n\\n# Step 3: Follow the right people\\n\\nYou want to follow accounts that have a lot of RT’s, and comments. Because the more engagement the more impressions. The more impressions the more your time spent on commenting on their tweets is rewarded.\\n\\n# Step 4: Tweet smart, not often\\n\\nIf you can tickle the algorithm to like you, your tweets will be shown to more people.\\n\\nThe basic rule is: always talk about them. I don’t have statistics on this but if YOU mention the word YOU in your tweet, chances are a lot bigger you’ll get more engagement while saying almost the same. They read you and think (he's talking about) me.\\n\\nTip: Have 10 quotes ready from the account you’re following. Once they tweet you immediately comment on his tweet with a quote (that’s easy with His Holiness) and you RT your tweet. (Don't do this yourself unless you are in the self-help niche)\\n\\nDon’t be blown away but you should be commenting about 10x - 15x a day on other people's timelines vs only tweeting 2 - 3x a day on your own to start with.\\n\\n# Step 5: What to tweet about\\n\\nTalk about your users. Show people interesting angles not directly related to your project. Don’t show screenshots from your product. Show something a user did or create a (small) case study.\\n\\nShare your ups and downs but always inspire. That means you can have a shitty day or a tweet that talks shit but people are more likely to engage if something is inspiring about it.\",\n",

       "  'body': '\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why Info Products (books, courses)?\\r\\n* One-time purchase is easier to sell.\\r\\n* Much easier to finish. There is an end in mind.\\r\\n* The payout is the opposite of SaaS (starting low and getting higher). You will sell a lot and then go down.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Build an Audience\\r\\n* This is the most crucial step for any future success.\\r\\n* One of the advantages is that audience makes up for any deficiency in your marketing.\\r\\n\\r\\n**How do I build an audience?**\\r\\n* **Be helpful on the internet**.\\r\\n* Help people where they are (in a Twitter timeline, for instance.)\\r\\n\\r\\n## How to come up with an idea?\\r\\nIdeas will come to you! Post useful stuff, people will engage, and ideas will come. No need to sit and brainstorm.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Make sure to record ideas when they come to you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTips on coming up with ideas for an info product:\\r\\n* What are people liking from what you post?\\r\\n* What are **you** excite about, that other people might be excited about.\\r\\n* What did you have to figure out yourself but was helpful to learn?\\r\\n    * Can you make it easier for others to learn this?\\r\\n    \\r\\n## Test your Idea\\r\\n1. Do \"tip tweets\" for the subject you plan to produce.\\r\\n2. If this gets traction, do something more in-depth like a blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\nTip: Catalog any useful feedback you get about your content. Twitter replies, blog post comments, etc. Not only will this direct you, but it will also be reused later.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Create a Landing Page.\\r\\n[Example](https://adamwathan.me/advanced-vue-component-design/)\\r\\n\\r\\n![48690b014c23849d5b3ab1affa3bcef3.png](:/015a38eb5f974e9ab838dfe7080a90fb)\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the things you need on your Landing page:\\r\\n1. Headline\\r\\n2. Short Description\\r\\n3. Call to Action: Signup to Email Newsletter\\r\\n    * Tip: make sure to provide an incentive: e.g., free screencasts, discount on launch.\\r\\n4. Proof that you know some of this stuff. Link to a blog post, for example.\\r\\n5. Social Proof: Testimonials, use the Tweet you saved earlier.\\r\\n6. Outline what you are going to include. No need to go too in-depth.\\r\\n7. Another signup form on the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\n![0ab3a46e3574d467a6be86dd01b211ce.png](:/031506819c344ad9ab8f7f62343082df)\\r\\n\\r\\n8. \"Who am I\" section.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Build an Email List.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Tell your audience about your launch. \\r\\n    * Tell them you have a landing page where they can sign up.\\r\\n    * Announce that you are about to announce your landing page.\\r\\n    ![1ba473498e18125e25464a51857366b5.png](:/998919861e934b64b5d561653117af3a)\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Share Progress** with your email list.\\r\\n    * Every week or so, send an update to your audience. Include a free video or a link to a live stream. \\r\\n    * Share before sending an email. Tweet to your audience that if they want to receive some free stuff to go ahead and signup.\\r\\n    ![86ed953e6c050620253af97a6d2ae969.png](:/00fc7b17865d48f59f270e58e524ba5b)\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Repurpose Content.\\r\\n    * Taking a chapter from the book and massaging it into a blog post. \\r\\n    * Add a signup form to that post.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Getting it finished.\\r\\n1. Make **public promises** to your audience.\\r\\n2. **Email on Schedule**. Once a week is good.\\r\\n3. **Reduce Scope**, if you can\\'t finish, but have produced good material already.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Figuring out Pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1. Tiered Pricing\\r\\n\\r\\n**Single Tier**\\r\\n* Can be fine if you charge enough\\r\\n* Often necessary if pre-selling\\r\\n* Nice if you can\\'t figure out a way to add extra tiers that actually feel valuable\\r\\n\\r\\n**Two Tiers** - Wes Bos Example\\r\\nReal product id the \"upper\" tier. \"Lower\" tier is like a crippled version of the \"upper\" tier. The real goal of that \"lower\" tier is to \"push\" people towards the upper tier. 2 products are $10 apart, but the second one has twice as much content.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks well with video courses.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Three Tiers**\\r\\n* great for books if you can come up with bonus content.\\r\\n* Makes it easier to evaluate as its own product instead of comparing to Amazon book prices\\r\\n* Prices are usually 1, ~2, ~5x.\\r\\n* This will make you a lot more money from a book than selling the book on its own.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2. Launch Discounts\\r\\n* Discount it by enough to be appealing, at least 30%\\r\\n* Use stepped discounts. Lower discounts on cheaper tiers and better discount on higher tiers\\r\\n* Reverse engineer non-discounted price from your planned discounted price\\r\\n    * i.e., If you want to charge $100 for your course and want to create a 30%, don\\'t apply that discount to $100. Rather price your product at $143 (100 / 0.7), which will turn into $100.\\r\\n    * We all have a tendency to undervalue our own work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Nailing the Launch\\r\\n\\r\\n**1. Build a Sales Page.**\\r\\n* Don\\'t try to sell too hard, since most of the visitors will come from an email.\\r\\n* Still include a signup form that sends preview content for new traffic, i.e., \"Signup to get 4 free preview lessons.\"\\r\\n* Testimonials and Social proof are important; use feedback from preview content to start.\\r\\n* Sort tiers from highest to lowest price, use visuals to communicate to higher tiers.\\r\\n![e944705fdfcbbcc8b7cf4d92ca21e5c4.png](:/e345714652ca4716a1db93220d0f91ba)\\r\\n\\r\\n**2. Announce the Launch Details**\\r\\n* Send an email notifying people you include the following:\\r\\n    * Include al package and pricing details\\r\\n    * Complete TOC or content list\\r\\n    * Final free content if possible\\r\\n\\r\\n**3. Launch it**\\r\\n* Send a super-simple email, saying it\\'s done and a link.\\r\\n    * Sending on Tuesdays seem good day to send to Adam, not stats.\\r\\n    * Morning EST works well for Adam.\\r\\n\\r\\n**4. Leverage Early Feedback**\\r\\n* Collect the feedback.\\r\\n* Use it in a follow-up email to people who did not buy the course.\\r\\n\\r\\n**5. Closing the Launch**\\r\\n* Email to notify people that this is the last email where you can buy this at this price. LAST CHANCE!\\r\\n* Don\\'t specify a closing date in advance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Other tips:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Books vs. Video Courses\\r\\n* Plan small; it will end up bigger than you think\\r\\n    * Short books are still books\\r\\n    * 3 hours is plenty for a video course\\r\\n* Books are a lot easier to work on, especially if you only have short blocks of time.\\r\\n* Courses are easier to sell at a higher price but a lot harder to produce on nights and weekends.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Should I pre-sell?\\r\\n**Advantages**:\\r\\n* best form of product validation\\r\\n* you\\'ll make more money since you can talk about your product more often. With every update, for instance.\\r\\n* more motivation to finish\\r\\n\\r\\n**Disadvantages**\\r\\n* Selling multiple tiers is trickier\\r\\n* Can\\'t easily change the scope\\r\\n* Can be extremely stressful\\r\\n\\r\\n## Resources\\r\\n* [Nailing Your First Launch - MicroConf Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajrDxZRpP9M)\\r\\n* [The Book Launch that let me quit my job - Adam\\'s Post](https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/)\\r\\n* [Tools for selling your product online - Adam\\'s List](https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/30dc4230ac575cfa3425b39ca11ea859)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Notes:\\r\\n* Adam uses Vimeo for video hosting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**strong text**',\n",

       "  'body': \"Hello everyone,\\n\\n# WELCOME\\nWelcome to Built with Django Podcast. I am your host Rasul Kireev. In this podcast we will be talking to makers who build products with Django. \\n\\n# QUICK BACKSTORY\\nI've run into Django about a year ago, mainly because I was a huge fan of Python and wanted to build products for the web. Django was surprisingly straight forward to learn, but the best thing about this learning experience was the community. It seemed and seems to me that people who are a part of Django community are just a group of extremely nice people. And the other thing is that this community is very large and many participants and porjects never get disocvered. This is where Built with Django was born.\\n\\nI wanted to collect all those awesome projects and makers who build with Django under one roof and show the world that Django is a superb web development framework. If you want some inspiration on what one can create with Django head over to the website. If you made something yourself, please submit your site!\\n\\n# PODCAST \\nIn this podcast I try to interview all the makers that are highlighted on the site. I will be asking questions around their experience with django. What was their experience learning, what were the most useful resources, what was hard, what was easy. We will also try to dig deepinto how their projects were built. \\n\\n# CONTACT ME\\nWe are still in an early phase of this podcast, so if you have any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to email me at rasul@builtwithdjango.com. I would love to hear your ideas.\\n\\nWelcome to the community, I hope you enjoy.\",\n",

       "  'body': '[Intro]\\nAlex is the founder of Unicorn Platform, a landing page builder for startups.\\n\\n[Notes]\\nHe is the only coder for the this project.\\nHe had 0 experience in backend development before building Unicorn.\\nHe has a little experience with front-end.\\nAlex is the organizer of Saint-Petersburg Indiehackers Community.\\n\\nALex thought he will have to hire a backend developer, but Alex\\'s friend Kostya pursuaded him to build it himself, offering his help along the way. The reasoning behind this was that this way Alex will know eveything \"under the hood\" of his project. This will make it much easier to fix any foture issues quickly. Additionally, knowing what the code is and what is required will make it easier to hire developers in the future.\\n\\n**Why Django?** \\nI just looked at what my friends are doing. Main influence were two of my friend who had ton of experience with Django. Those friend also offered to help me along the way.\\n\\n**Did you learn Django while building Unicorn, or tested on a couple of projects beforehand?**\\nHe was planning to build a demo project but dropped the idea. I needed the result quick, plus ther would be no difference between the playground and the real thing.\\n\\nBackend is actually not that hard. Not much logic there. Just a couple dRF enfpoint and custom domain logic.\\n\\n**What is your preferred frontend framework**\\nI started with JQuery since I knew it better, but for the second version of Unicorn platform I decided to implement and effectively learn React.js.\\n\\n**What resources were useful to you when you were learning Django?**\\nI get tired of books really easilly! However, I still used it sometimes. For the most part I just Googled any problems that I had. Googling (DuckDuckGoing in my case) and StackOverflowing is the most important developer skill :)\\n\\n**Any other project you built with Django?**\\nNo. not really. This is the only big project of mine, and the only Django project of mine.\\n\\n**Why did you decide to build Unicorn Platform, given that there are many similar projects?**\\nIs was one of the most simplest choices in my life. I failed in my previous startup, which failed because I was focused on making money. I returned back home and was bankrupt and without a job. Once I thought what next, I created a simple list of things I love. There were obvious things like cats and travelling (everyone loves those). Also, there wars not so obvious stuff like web dev, startups. Looking at that list I sorted by the market size (great according to Justin Jackson). I removed high cost and small market choices. The top points were design and web development. People have problems designing sites, so... Website builder it is, let\\'s go baby and that\\'s now I\\'m here!\\n\\n**Who are your users?**\\nI meet a lot of IH members in Saint Petersburg (I\\'m organizer) and when people ask me which project to choose I tell them that having passion for that project is crucial. You must go for the money, but if you don\\'t have a real, hoset passion with your project, your interest will die down with time.\\n\\n39 from US\\n9 from UK\\n6 from Australia\\n10 from Russia\\n7 from France\\n3 from Spain\\n5 from Canada\\n3 from Mexico\\n\\n**Stripe does not work in Russia, how did you deal with that?**\\nGreat question, people always ask me. I recommend using Paddle, much simplier than Stripe.\\n\\n**How long it took you to build the MVP?**\\nSometimes people spend too much time on an MVP. I usually tell them my example. I built mine in 160 hours. It was a simple static landing page generator. You were only allowed to pick major UI decision and you got a simple HTML that you can edit your self later. Hosting was done by the client also. This iteration was more for the \"geeks\" / techies. But it prooved a demand for such product, therefore it was a great MVP. Then a yearl later I built the full project.\\n\\n**Was there any feedback on your MVP?**\\nIt got a lot of interest and upvotes on PH, 3-5 customers per month without any further contribution from me.\\n\\n**How long did it take to get your first payment?**\\n160 hours later. Same day as PH launch.\\n\\n**Are you working full-time on Unicorn Platform?**\\nYes. Actually to solve my bankruptcy ploblem, I hosted a crowdfunding campaign. In return for a financial return I promised free accounts when the product is launched. This helped me raise $10k.\\n\\n**How did you go about your crowdsource campaign?**\\nEveryone\\'s path is different. I can only talk about my path ad=nd if you think that is the way you want to go, I am happy to help. There are small communities of 1000 people who hunt very small launches. I made a landing page and said that I will sell 50 lifetime licenses. The price for that was 180$. Couple of things that helped were that Alex is an active PH member and had a solid MVP.\\n\\n**What is the best way to reach you?**\\nisora.me I have a bunch of links there.\\n\\n**Do you plan on working on something else?**\\nUsually, I could get bored easily, but not with this project. It consumed me. The secret is that I started doing what I wanted to. I plan to do a couple more project later this year. My ideas will be focused on helping startups. A startup checklist, and an emoji picker for web designers. I will be working on other projects, but only to help my main project, Unicorn Platform.\\n\\n**You planning on moving to Japan?**\\nI generally love Japan, so does my girlfriend. In about a year we\\'ll just pack our  bags and go to Japan. I anticipate it will be around $3k per person to live and learn Japanese in Japan.\\n\\n**Is there anything I didn\\'t ask?**\\n\\n\\n[Links Mentioned]\\nuniconplatform.com\\nisora.me\\n**Crowdfunding**\\nIndieGoGo\\nKickstarter\\nAppSumo\\nPaddle\\n\\n[Notes for myself for future interviews]\\nPrepare an intro for the guest.\\n* If interviewee mentions something technical, amke sure to ask about it.\\n* Cut down on personal stories after each interviwee answer.\\n\\n[Notes for myself for future producer]\\n* When taking notes, the easiest way is to right down my question and right a short summary of the answer. Usually interviwee gives a solid answer in the first couple of sentences.\\n* Cutting interuptions and muting them.\\n* When there is an interruption I simply delete the block, making sure the transition makes sense.\\n\\n[Ask Alex before launch]\\n* What was that small community that \"hunted\" your launch (where you sold 50 licenses).\\n',\n",

Сегодня была та же с грибами и новая с капустой тушеной... очень вкусно.\\n\\nЧто касается работы, сегодня почти ничего не было сделано к сожалению, поэтому тяжесть некоторых заданий падет на завтра. Пожалуй с точки зрения задержки, самое важное будет записать интро для Алекса и целый интро эпизод. Для эпизода нужно слегка подготовить речь. \\n\\nПомимо этих двух заданий хотелось бы подготовить оутлайн для курса. Чувствую чт осени останавливает не уверенность в том какой проект стоит копировать для примера , так как я не могу полностью все скопировать. Но думаю это не проблема, стоит писать курс про спас нежели чем про что-то определённое. Уверен что получится все, удачи. \\n\\nСегодня с Таней принимали душ. Было очень прикольно и необычно, даже занялись любовью в душе , а потом ещё и на диване. Я сегодня везде побрился. \\n\\nЕщё приобрёл две настольные игры и две игры для PlayStation. Exploding Kittens и Codenames Duo , а для PlayStation LEGO Harry Potter и парную игру о побеге из тюрьмы, так сказать эскейп.  Первым делом попробовали Гарри Поттера , неплохо. \\n\\n[13:53]\\nСегодня утром хорошо проснулись, я сделал завтрак и потом поболтали с Айкой и Мамой где-то полтора часа. \\n\\nСейчас поставил свой компьютерный сетап, микрофон, жесткий диск, все как надо короче. Надо всего лишь записать два видео/аудио. Интро для Саши и Интро жпизод. Жумаю правильно будет пирдумать сначала какой нибудь текст по котору потом буду говрить/читать. Помимо этого нужно бужет внести все траты с русской карьы в ЛанчМани и можно день считать удавщимся с точки зрения работы.\\n\\nСейчас еще хочу Камилле быстро звякнуть. После этого пойдем прогуляемся с легка, так как погода хорошая. \\n\\nКстати, думаю о своем метапе продуктивности в Асане и мне в принципе все очень даже нравиться.',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n\\n[09:08]\\nСегодня утром доделал хлеб, выглядит неплохо, посмотрим какой на вкус получился. Немного обжегся. После стэндапа сегодня пойду подготовлю кругляшки для пиццы, чтобы к вечеру уже были готовы. Наддесб будет вкусно, надо будет продумать начинку. В люом случае в ней будет помидоры.\\n\\nПоработал немного нал сайтом сегодня. Продвигается нормально. Есть погрености, но динамика есть. Думаб демо версия моего \"сада\" будет готова к концу недели. \\n\\nНад оутлайном еще не работал. Как только закончу писать здесь, перейду именно к нему.\\n\\nДобавил сегодня утром мета таги для Built with Django. К подкастам пока боюсь прикоснуться :( Но кровь износу надо. Так как на одно интервью будет уходить примерно три-четыре часа, нужно расчитывать что оставгиеся 2 интервью займут часов 8. Чисто теоретически эта задача полностью выполнима. До конца месяца осталось где-то 15 дней, 10 из которых будние. Соответсвенно у меня гдето 15-20 часов свободных есть на выполнение этой задачи. Но, не стоит забывать и про другие задачи. На данный момент эти задачи в себя включают:\\n* Course Outline\\n* Built with Django UI\\n* Personal Website\\n\\nПока больше ничего не приходит в голову. Больше времени хотелось бы уделять следующим вещам:\\n* Dj-Stripe integration\\n* Tolstoy Newsletter\\n* Writing\\n\\nОсобенно потому что два из этих пункта проекты которые я сто процентов могу закончить. На толстого мне нужно примерно 3 часа, на Django Stripe примерно столько же. В принципе это очень даже неплохое подитоживание текущих проектов. Надо будет это саморизировать и поместить в productivity tracker от Nat. Сейчас еще раз на него гляну и начну outline.\\n\\n[11:32]\\nПишу в своём новом Айфоне который мне прислала компания. Прикольно. Знаю что основная задача такого телефона это то что я могу безопасно входить в систему и использовать двухфакторную идентификацию и также входить в имейл. Но насколько я понял я могу его и для своих личных целей использовать. Так что наскочат несколько приложений 😁. \\n\\nВечер прошёл хорошо. Сделали пиццу, было очень вкусно. В последнее время по вечерам быстро устаю. И на радо к если честно немного прогресса в последние несколько дней. \\n\\nСпокойной ночи и хорошего завтра дня. ',\n",

Но когда я послал второе письмо в догонку заметил что и там була ошибка в оглавлении... Грустно, но ничего страшного. Постораюсь таких ошибок больше не совершать. В общем выглядит так что я буду отправлять это письмо по вторникам. Думаю для начала неплохо. Буду надеяться что подписчики подскажут как улучшаться и делать письма лучше.\\n\\nКстати, эти журнальные записи довольно-то хорошо помогали при составлении письма. Было удобно видеть что я на этой неделе делал, что читал и что добовлял в SB.\\n\\nПолучил уведомление о том что получили 1200 от государства США! Очень необычное ощущение если честно. Это означает что сегодня я полностью гашу счет по кредитной карте!!! И мы выходим на более менее спокойный уровень по финансам!!! останеться тольуо погасить последний кредит который мы взяли и все.\\n\\nСегодня утром начал делать хдеб и пиццу. Не самый лучший день я для этого выбрал, так как он довольно забитый будет, но думаю все получиться, сейчас минут через 10 пойду делать первый стретч для пиццы.\\n\\nЧто-то еще было что хотел рассказать. Говорил же что забуду :)\\n\\nДоговорился с чуваком созвониться насчет магазина, может получиться вместе работать. Сегодня буду записывать подкаст интервью с Коди одним из первых чуваков который запостил проект на Built with Django. \\n\\nВ последние несколько дней тяжело просыпается и изза этого в целом как-то сбивается утренний ритуал. Например подкастом на этой неделе я не занимался. Сегодня наверное тоже не поллучиться. уже блин 9 утра. Скоро рабочий день начнется.\\n\\nВчера еще написал Нейт из newline насчет первого отулайна который я ему отправил. Говорит что оутлайн ему понравился, но и таак много блогов и сайтов пишут о том как забахать блог с помощью Джанго. Ему больше понравилась идея о том как сделать приложение SaaS с помощь Джанго. Так что сейчас работаю над оутлайном для этого курса. Не могу пока придумать какой взять в пример, возможно придется оставить название именно таким, How to Build a SaaS with Django. ',\n",

But given small time constraints journaling is the obvious choice, for me at least. There is just more value I get from it in this short amount of time. It's hard to put in words what are those advantages, but I can feel them. For one thing, nine minute of exercises is not enough given how long it takes to get in the zone. (That's not really an advantage to journaling, rather a disadvantage to coding). \\n\\nSometimes I forget to do a journal entry during the day and knowing that I already did that is a good feeling, one that can make me do more of those entries. If I was to look at my data I would see that on average it takes me around 10 minutes to make a journal entry. \\n\\n> That makes me remember that it is really hard to see this kind of data in toggl. Thakfully it is supposed to be easier to use their API which should in a list of projects of mine. Enhance Toggl reporting.\\n\\n> Also a good idea for a newsletter. Share project ideas.\\n\\nA lot of the time this short journal entry can spark a couple of good ideas I can put in my second brain(SB) to review later, like the two ideas above. Awesome. I will stop the entry now, will add the ideas above to my SB and join the stand up call.\\n\\n\\n[10:09]\\nJust added [Philip Kiely](:/3b543337061241c4add9230f25f01d8e) to my SB and a cool HN thread on [Mind Bending Read](:/9c04825af6444711a9f38b054e026aa9).

       "  'body': '# Show Your Work by Austin Kleon\\n\\n> The world is changing at such a rapid rate that it’s turning us all into amateurs. Even for professionals, the best way to flourish is to retain an amateur’s spirit and embrace uncertainty and the unknown\\n\\n\\n> The best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.\\n\\n\\n> the only way to find your voice is to use it. It’s hardwired, built into you. Talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow.\\n\\n\\n> “Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.” —Steve Jobs\\n\\n\\n> Become a documentarian of what you do. Start a work journal: Write your thoughts down in a notebook, or speak them into an audio recorder. Keep a scrapbook. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages in your process. Shoot video of you working. This isn’t about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. Take advantage of all the cheap, easy tools at your disposal—these days, most of us carry a fully functional multimedia studio around in our smartphones. Whether you share it or not, documenting and recording your process as you go along has its own rewards: You’ll start to see the work you’re doing more clearly and feel like you’re making progress. And when you’re ready to share, you’ll have a surplus of material to choose from.\\n\\n\\n> Overnight success is a myth. Dig into almost every overnight success story and you’ll find about a decade’s worth of hard work and perseverance. Building a substantial body of work takes a long time—a lifetime, really—but thankfully, you don’t need that time all in one big chunk. So forget about decades, forget about years, and forget about months. Focus on days.\\n\\n\\n> Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share. Where you are in your process will determine what that piece is. If you’re in the very early stages, share your influences and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress. If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned. If you have lots of projects out into the world, you can report on how they’re doing—you can tell stories about how people are interacting with your work.\\n\\n\\n> Always be sure to run everything you share with others through The “So What?” Test. Don’t overthink it; just go with your gut. If you’re unsure about whether to share something, let it sit for 24 hours. Put it in a drawer and walk out the door. The next day, take it out and look at it with fresh eyes. Ask yourself, “Is this helpful? Is it entertaining? Is it something I’d be comfortable with my boss or my mother seeing?” There’s nothing wrong with saving things for later. The save as draft button is like a prophylactic—it might not feel as good in the moment, but you’ll be glad you used it in the morning.\\n\\n\\n> More than 10 years ago, I staked my own little Internet claim and bought the domain name austinkleon.com. I was a complete amateur with no skills when I began building my website: It started off bare bones and ugly. Eventually, I figured out how to install a blog, and that changed everything. A blog is the ideal machine for turning flow into stock: One little blog post is nothing on its own, but publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work. My blog has been my sketchbook, my studio, my gallery, my storefront, and my salon. Absolutely everything good that has happened in my career can be traced back to my blog. My books, my art shows, my speaking gigs, some of my best friendships—they all exist because I have my own little piece of turf on the Internet.\\n\\n\\n> Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who you are and what you do—sometimes even more than your own work.\\n\\nPeople you follow for example\\n\\n\\n> “The impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.” —Annie Dillard\\n\\n\\n> The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and video. Take people step-by-step through part of your process. As blogger Kathy Sierra says, “Make people better at something they want to be better at.” Teaching people doesn’t subtract value from what you do, it actually adds to it. When you teach someone how to do your work, you are, in effect, generating more interest in your work. People feel closer to your work because you’re letting them in on what you know\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '# Principles by Dalio, Ray\\r\\n\\r\\n> Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2 . .\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinciple #1\\r\\n\\r\\n> Don’t let fears of what others think of you stand in your way.\\r\\n\\r\\n> For as long as I have been practicing this, I still know I can’t see myself objectively, which is why I continue to rely so much on the input of others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Ultimately, it comes down to the following five decisions: 1. Don’t confuse what you wish were true with what is really true. 2. Don’t worry about looking good—worry instead about achieving your goals. 3. Don’t overweight first-order consequences relative to second- and third-order ones. 4. Don’t let pain stand in the way of progress. 5. Don’t blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> 14 I’m sure Transcendental Meditation, which I have been practicing regularly for nearly half a century, helped provide me with the equanimity I needed to approach my challenges this way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> 15 You shouldn’t assume that you are always the best person to make decisions for yourself because often you aren’t.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> If you can do those five things well, you will almost certainly be successful. Here they are in a nutshell: 1. Have clear goals. 2. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals. 3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. 4. Design plans that will get you around them. 5. Do what’s necessary to push these designs through to results.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> If you want to reach your goals, you must be calm and analytical\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don’t is their willingness to look at themselves and others objectively and understand the root causes standing in their way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Practice higher-level thinking by looking down on your machine and thinking about how it can be changed to produce better outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> It’s important to remember the connections between your tasks and the goals that they are meant to achieve. When you feel yourself losing sight of that, stop and ask yourself “why?” Lose sight of the why and you will surely lose sight of your goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Understand your ego barrier\\r\\n\\r\\n> Understand your blind spot barrier\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> For example, some people naturally see big pictures and miss small details while others naturally see details and miss big pictures; some people are linear thinkers while others think laterally, and so on. Naturally,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Radical open-mindedness allows you to escape from the control of your lower-level you and ensures your upper-level you sees and considers all the good choices and makes the best possible decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> behind alternative points of view. To\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Triangulate your view with believable people who are willing to disagree. By questioning experts individually and encouraging them to have thoughtful disagreement with each other that I can listen to and ask questions about, I both raise my probability of being right and become much better educated.\\r\\n\"\"\"Idea for a podcast\"\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Plan for the worst-case scenario to make it as good as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> you can significantly raise your probabilities of making the right decisions by open-mindedly triangulating with believable people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Understand how you can become radically open-minded\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> you’d like to experience some of these assessments for yourself and see your own results, visit assessments.principles.com.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> New is overvalued relative to great. For example, when choosing which movie to watch or what book to read, are you drawn to proven classics or the newest big thing? In my opinion, it is smarter to choose the great over the new.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n> Your evolutionary process can be described as a 5-Step Process for getting what you want. It consists of setting goals, identifying and not tolerating problems, diagnosing problems, coming up with designs to get around them, and then doing the tasks required. The important thing to remember is that no one can do all the steps well, but that it’s possible to rely on others to help. Different people with different abilities working well together create the most powerful machines to produce achievements\\r\\n\\r\\n> ISSUE LOG The Issue Log is our primary tool for recording our mistakes and learning from them.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n[21:29]\\nСегодня будет быстрая запись. \\n\\nПоболтали по зума сегодня с моими. \\n\\nОтправил Нэйту первый оутлайн для курса по Джанго. На этот счет волнуюсь немного. Пока он смотрит на этот оутлайн, буду работать над еще одним. В целом тема это SaaS app но нужно что-то более конкретное. Сейчас думаю над тет какое должно быть приложение которые мы будем \"копировать\".\\n\\nНикак не могу собраться и сделать комбучу. Видимо процесс потерял свою новизну и я немного остыл к этому хобби. Думаю в принципе это нормально... Сейчас посмотрю как можно приостановить процесс, чтобы в случае заново родившегося интереса возоюновить процесс. Даже больше это относиться к приготовлению кефира. Так как его делать нужно каждый ден, более того для этого нужно молоко которое мы особо не закупаем, это хобби на данный момент потеряло весь свой смысл. Так что сегодня нужно посмотреть как эти два процесса приостановить.\\n\\nХороший день дома с Таней сегодня проводим. Вкусно поужинали и сейчас смотрим французский фильм. Сегодня даже потанцевали немного, но спортом не занимались. В последнее время чаще играем в Trivial Pursuit. Нужно будет найти какую нибудь новую настольную игру. Может быть что нибудь классичное, типо Дженга. Кстати нужно будет еще научить Таню играть в Покер.\\n\\nСегодня написал Тристану Зомси насчет того что Тим Феррисс упомянл его в своем подкасте. Задумываюсь насчет того чтобы подписаться на сервис Readwise. Все от него в невероятном восторге, может стоит задуматься. Кстати, это хорошая идея для микро саас бизнеса. Человек отмечает / запоминает текст который ему будет проиходить каждый день. По идее эта идея очень проста в имплементации и легка в окончании. Думаю это должен ыбть мой первый \"серьезный\" проект после окончания \"туториалов\" по имейлу и stripe. Кстати говоря нужно эти проекты возобновить. Возможно я пока поставлю свой проект по одежде для разработчиков на паузу. Да, запишу эту задачу в Тудуист да и еще парочку о тех что я сказал выше.\\n\\n[23:09]\\nПоставил комбучу и кефир на паузу. Поставил магазин одежды на паузу на 3 месяца огромный груз с плеч! Потом выкинули мусор и немного пребрались. Зарегестрировался на readwise. Отличный сайт. За пять секунд загрузил все свои заметки туда! Все. С Покет, С my_clippings. Мне конечно помжно отдать должное за внимательное хранение этих клиппингов, но блин это было просто. Теперь видимо буду получать уведомление от Readwise со всеми заметками. Еще очень удобная фитча это возможностьб экспортировать заметки по книге или статье в маркдаун. Это просто бомба. Если бы он еще знал из какой главы книги эта заметка это просто можно было бы башку взорвать! Вау!!!! Очень, очень круто.\\n\\nЗавтра надо будет спросить как сделано приложение. Если Джанго то срочно нужно приглашать на подкаст, если нет, то тоже на подкаст. Начал вести список людей которых смогу на свой подкаст пригласить кстати [Road 2 Independence Podcast](:/2ef0724e45c24a52bf7cf618f8c55943).\\n\\nВсе, теперь иду спать с любимой женой <3. ',\n",

Более того, иногда следует задуматься на какие жертыв можем пойти ради нашего будущего и будущего нащих детей и их детей.\\n\\nТолько что написал Стиву Шрогеру в Твиттер с просьбой дать совет насчет того как лучше обучиться искусству создания дизайнов для сайтов. Столкнулся с этим когда придумывал как будет выглядить Детальный Вид для Built with Django. Сегодня хочу закончить эти рещения дизайна и запустить апдейты в сеть. После хотел бы закончить продумывать примеры для маркетинга и можно будет подумать про следующие шаги. Автомотизированные email (скорее всего нет), регистрация ползьвоталей для комментариев и тому подобное.\\n\\nНа днях Таня мне сказала что не хватает романтики, и в целом это быда шутка. Но как мы знаем, в каждой щутке есть доля правды. Не в этом суть, я и сам об этом задумывался. Хочу сказать что меня немного растраивает что, в этих девниковых записях я фокусируюсь на работе, проектах, интересах, но не о своей любимой женщине, не о нашем время препровождении. Не говорю о наших хороших моментах, не о наших ссорах. Это очень важная часть моей жизни. Более такого, это скорее всего самая большая часть моей жизни. Так что впредь хотел бы чаще писать об этом, хорошем и плохом. \\n\\nЕсли это кто-то читает, заранее извиняюсь.\\n\\nВ последнее время проблемы сексуального характера. У меня в целом пропало жедание заниматься любовью. ДА и вообще член в течении дня особо не встает. Не знаю с чем это связано, честно. Могу только предпологать. Естественно, первое что лезет голову это обвинения в адрес других людей. Но чаще всего проблемы оказываются внутри нас. Вообще жто все не в первый раз, от чего становиться грустно. Кстати, Таня права, может стоить к сексологу сходить для этого. Думаю в этом не ничего плохого. Одна из больщих проблем для меня (и ту вообще стыдно рассказывать! Надеюсь это никто не прочитает.) это что не смотря на мою любовь к минету, мне неудобно о нем просить и представлять как я его получаю от Тани. Со временем, у меня сложилось крепкое впесаление что ей это делать не нравиться. Короче вот как то так. Не знаю как дальше это все будет развиваться. Пока этот чертов коронавирус, даже к врачу особо не сходишь. В остаьлном у нас вроде все отлично, улыбаемся, играем, шутим, и так далее.',\n",

К этоу решению я пришел пока эдитил первый эпизод для подкаста Built with Django. Само интервью шло 45 минут. Мне это дело отредактировать и законспектировать занимает где-то 3-4 часа... Это слишком много есть много веще которые я могу делать в это время. Я рад что попробовал это дело, и наверное еще пару подкастов я запишу, но потом хотелось бы с этого дела соскочить, поэтому искать надо начинать сейчас.\\n\\nВчера так и не помедитировал, но много всего другого полезного сделал. Поздравили Гошана с друзьями. С Таней, хороший спокойный вечер вместе провели, посмотрели французский фильм Леон, комедию с Дэни Буном.\\n\\nВечером пришло письмо от Nate Murray (from Newline) где он сказал что возможно зотел бы поработать со мной над курсом по Джанго. Попросил прислать Outline потенциального курса. Я наверное сделаю два ouline, один для персонального сайта, другой для SaaS приложения. Ох, это конечно много, много работы если все таки меня выбирут, но очень крутой опыт!\\n\\nУтром почти до конца оформил эпизод первй подкаста. Осталось еще совсем чуть чуть. Наверное как только закочну писать этот блок приступлю к заверщению. Если останеться время почитаю немного. Медитацию наверное перенесу на обед.\\n\\n[09:37]\\nУоооооооу. Закончил первый эпизод. Осталось только щаписать интро, и всееееее! Перехожу ко второму эпизоду.',\n",

Spent roughly an hour surfing on the web (could do a little less), then started Poscast editing. I like the process. I already have a good idea as to what to send in a Newsletter. It will be similar to what Courtland is doing, where he sends an email with podcast highlights. I thougt of it, only cause I am naturally taking a lot of notes while listening / editing the poscast. The serious con of this is how much time it takes to edit. I am only past the 8th minute, out of 45. Hopefully will do some editting today, not sure if will be able to complete it though. - [Alex Isora Notes](:/86d111f4013e4d06aca39d4a24ceeabb)\\n\\nThen I had an early call with my colleagues at 8:30. The call lasted a little over an hour. Once that was finished I did a little excercise, had a coldish shower and then sat down to read. Two things I forgot to do are a journal entry (doing now) and meditation (will do between the next two meetings). \\n\\nWhile reading added a couple of interesting notes, [TIL - 2020/05/06](:/282bf2d40b9444839ec0631ef968f79a). Learning are about interesting ways of public stunts by startup companies. Finished updating notes I took while reading [How to be a Capitalist without any Capital](:/28b1a06042064deca93be920db29777a). This means I need to create a folder for books notes with a formatted front-matter. I need to start collecting my book notes for the website. Don't think I will publush them in the next week, but hopefully will have enough some time mid June.\\n\\nI also emailed pending email subscribers for my Newsletter. One of the guys is pretty cool actually.\\n\\nOne last thing. I need to create a name for my newsletter. I like Musings by [David Perell](:/994ee7f867254c019bb8318af835fea3) and Medley by [Nat Eliason](:/54211d44226e483c98eae69cc71a0cc9).\\n\\nToday is Goshan's birthday. Scheduled a call with all our friends to congratulate him. :thumbsup.\\n\\n[13:36]\\nJust added a bunch on notes for a few articles. I gave those a light reading, quickly glancing over them. Most of them came from the Founder Weekly Newsletter.\\n[On building slow burn companies 🔥](:/ef6f9c021a3641d1974e45a649a2e6b0), [The 6 builders who will thrive in the new world](:/042674405a8f43c1b68e8627b9373fc9), [Images that MUST accompany every startup PR pitch](:/932a3cbbfd044c40a11d1362e6c1f348). \\n\\nAlso, found a cool guide for course publishing - [How to create, sell, and profit from an online course in 2020](:/77588d2363094d008a5b215fa163c6a4). Also found it on Founder Weekly. Following that rabbit hole led me to the following article - [50 Big Companies that Started with Little or No Money](:/eb3f3a18bd1f4762bf746e3e1520eb19).\\n\\n\\n[13:44]\\nToday's entry has a lot of links. That is associated with the fact that I just received a weekly Founder newsletter issue ,but also with the fact that I don't have immediate action to do at work. And finally that I am procrastinating on the importnatn tasks, like sending an email newsletter. I don't think the aticles I have added in the last couple of hours will add a ton of value to my second brain. Well, they will at least a bit, but there are other things with higher impact I could focus on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': 'https://wfh.substack.com/p/the-6-builders-who-will-thrive-in\\n\\nWith the proliferation of open-source, no-code/creators tools and new professional networks, the builders who will thrive in the new world will not only ‘think different’, but look and build different.\\n\\nThe 6 types of builders who will thrive in the new world: \\n\\n## The Designers who Code\\n\\nWhen we combine technical excellence with opinionated design, we arrive at the designers who can code. Shipping an MVP and iterating based on user feedback is the default for startups; committing to a creative vision and marrying art with technical acumen and user-informed, but not dictated, features has created multiple $2B+ category leading companies: Figma, Notion to name a few. \\n\\n## The Career Jumpers\\n\\nThe career jumpers collect and synthesize the expertise and skills they’ve gained across sectors into new insights, moving from law to biometrics or publishing to technology. Or Tech Twitter’s favorite: tech journalism to venture capital. \\n\\n## The Ambitious Advisors\\n\\nAdvisors, agencies and freelance executives have a unique upper-hand: access. \\n\\n\\n## The Creative Hackers\\n\\nThe creative hackers win friends, influence people, and break the internet. They find ways to bring products and experiences to life without writing code. Instead, they dream up big projects and forge partnerships to bring them to fruition or build with flexible no-code tools. \\n\\n## The Industry Academics\\n\\nAcademics are finding new homes. Companies like DeepMind and OpenAI recruit research scientists with PhDs to solve complex challenges in artificial intelligence. We also see academics infiltrating marketing and growth teams at companies like Airbnb and Slack as data scientists or venture capital firms as research fellows or scientists-in-residence. Academics are in a unique position to merge their deep expertise with industry experience to become innovative founders. \\n\\n## The Community Builders\\n\\nThe community builders frequently angel invest in the next generation of companies in their category and bring a high level of transparency to educate founders and support individual creators. \\n\\nCommunity builders are natural company builders. They value thoughtful curation and quality; they eschew the attitude of growth at all costs. As founders, they’re natural evangelists who invest in user education and steadily increase revenue.

       "  'body': \"How to Be a Capitalist Without Any Capital: The Four Rules You Must Break to Get Rich\\nNathan Latka\\n\\n---\\n\\nRule 1 - Don't Focus on One Thing\\nRule 2 - Copy your Competitors\\nRule 3 - Quit Setting Goals - They are Keeping you Broke\\nRule 4 - Sell Pickaxes to Gold Miners\\n\\n## Rule 1 - Don't Focus on One Thing\\n\\nOne thing I’m betting on is that as we move into the next four or five years, people are going to hate the idea of paying rent. They’ll much rather pay a monthly subscription fee to live anywhere they want in the world. If I want to tap into that demand, I’ll have to own hostels in multiple cities around the world. People will pay me one fee of, say, $1K per month and they can choose to stay in whichever one of my properties they want, whenever they want. They’ll have location freedom.\\n\\n## Rule 2 - Copy your Competitors\\n\\nFacebook very publicly copied Snapchat. When Snapchat released Snapchat Stories, Facebook rolled out Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories. When Snapchat released disappearing messages, Facebook added that to its messaging app. Facebook was ruthless—it went feature by feature and copied every one\\n\\n\\n## Rule 3 - Quit Setting Goals - They are Keeping you Broke\\n\\nSystems can pump out goals at a higher and higher speed the more you refine them, with minimal input from you. It’s why smart people build systems to join the New Rich, and it’s why broke people stay broke as they obsess over goals\\n\\nSystems thinking requires you to give up making money today in exchange for taking the time, energy, and sweat equity to set up systems that will do the work for you in the future. It’s a lot of up-front work, and that’s the problem for most people. They prefer the short-term win. They need the instant gratification. They want to have sex right now\\n\\n[Outsourcing]\\nStart/End Blindness also trips people up. A multilayered project can have several systems, but it can be hard to articulate where a system starts or stops—or where another begins\\n\\n## Rule 4 - Sell Pickaxes to Gold Miners\\n\\n\\n[Look in These Seven Places to Find Your Next $5K]\\nTalk to customers but don’t actually do what they say. If customers tell you they want food delivered to their door weekly, don’t go compete with Thrive Market, HelloFresh, and Blue Apron. Rather, go figure out what those business models rely on and build that.\\n\\nLook at what’s trending on Kickstarter campaigns and other crowdfunding sites. If something gets overfunded you know that’s a hot space and things are trending generally in that direction. Consumers gave Liberty+ Soundbuds more than $1.7M via Kickstarter. Combine that with Apple AirPods, and all the other companies playing in the sound/voice space like Google Home and Amazon Echo. The upward numbers are a strong signal that sound/audio is a thriving market. All of these agencies help you build Alexa Skills to deliver your audio content to consumers with Alexa devices in your home. Their consulting agency is the pickax to the voice/audio gold mine.\\n\\nScan Patreon.com to see which digital products are hot. Creators in everything from comics to podcasts publish how much they’re making each month. This will give you a sense of what’s working and what’s not. At the time of this writing, I could see in Patreon’s podcasting section that Chapo Trap House is making more than $100K per month. Go to their creator page and study why their patrons are donating to them. Listen to their content and figure out why it’s so popular. This will help give you ideas about things you might build to help them serve their audiences. If you want to do something in the tech space, watch which ProductHunt.com products get the most up votes.\\n\\n## Rule 5 - the New Rich Arsenal\\n\\n[Should You Use Fear To Sell?]\\nI’ve found seven fear principles that are most directly tied to driving sales and cash flow. This is not a definitive list of persuasion tactics. There are plenty of other things you can do to, say, convince your partner to stay with you, or your kid to do his homework. The focus here is on getting people to buy from you, or getting them to do what you want as it relates to cash in and out of your pocket.\\nWhen thinking about how your business ties into these, it’s not so much about how you can blatantly use one of these fears to sell your product. Rather, if you understand which fear you’re catering to, you can make sure your messaging reflects that. So if you were selling into Fear of the Unknown, you’d use words and phrases like “hidden,” “clever,” “never before seen” versus selling into Fear of Missing Out with words like “too late,” “few left,” “regret it later,” etc\\n\\n[Negotiate When you Don't Have to]\\nDream in Decades → Think in Years → Work in Weeks → Live in Days\\n\\n[How the New Rich Get More Done in Less Time]\\nThis is why the world’s most efficient people batch time. And that alone gives the New Rich a huge advantage over others who let the distractions rule them. While everyone else is bouncing around to a thousand minor tasks a day—and not getting anything meaningful done—they don’t put up with it. Never mind those who hire assistants to do the little things for them. You’ll get there, but not soon enough if you don’t take ownership of your time so you can get the big work done.\\nThe concept of batching time is simple: dedicate blocks of time (at least three hours) to one task or project. No switching to do little things in between. If you have multiple big projects going on, it helps to batch time by days instead of hours. This is how Jack Dorsey runs both Square and Twitter. In an interview with Techonomy, he explained how he runs the two companies simultaneously:\\nThe only way to do this is to be very disciplined and very practiced. The way I found that works for me is I theme my days. Monday at both companies I focus on management and running the company. We have our directional meeting at Square and we have our OpCom meeting at Twitter. Tuesday is focused on product. Wednesday is focused on marketing and communications and growth. Thursday is focused on developers and partnerships. Friday is focused on the company and the culture and recruiting. Saturday I take off, I hike. Sunday is reflections, feedback, strategy and getting ready for the rest of the week. . . . It sets a good cadence for the rest of the company so that we are always delivering, we are always showing where we were last week and where we are going to be the following week.\\nBy batching his time Dorsey is living in days and working in weeks, always looking at the bigger picture with both companies.\\n\\n\\n## 7 - Live Like a King without Owning a Thing\\n\\nTurn $100 into $1K Using Smart eBay Trading-Up Strategies\\nThis one’s fun, and you can go as far as you want with it. Go on eBay and look for an auction or a first sale that’s about to close. Then look up the same item on Amazon. If it’s more expensive on eBay than it is on Amazon, buy one or two on Amazon and then list them immediately on eBay.\\nThis isn’t totally hassle-free. eBay takes a cut of your earnings, and you have to deal with shipping the item. There’s also the risk of your buyer wanting to return the item. But it’s worth it if you resell big-ticket items like electronics. You can make an easy $1K or $2K in one weekend if you focus solely on flipping expensive items.\\n\\n[You have to Read this Email]\\nGo on Airbnb and find your dream property. Sort from most expensive to least expensive. Then email the owner and say you want to use the space to host a private gathering with top-level people in that city. It can be any group with a high profile—CEOs, artists, VCs, or whoever you think the owner of that property would want to meet. Say you’re inviting these people over and name a few, even if you don’t know them. Just say you plan to invite them. Once you get the place at a deep discount, use its beautiful pictures when inviting the talent whom you might not even know. They’ll feed off each other. When you do this, you’re basically becoming a broker between the Airbnb host and the guests you’re bringing in. Anyone can leverage this strategy. It just takes balls and courage to go out and actually do the negotiation.\\n\\n\\n## 8 - How to Invest in Real Estate: (even if you Have No Cash, No Clue, and No Time)\\n\\nThis scenario isn’t that unusual. The best real estate deals are found by door knocking and it’s the number one way I suggest you look for your first properties\\n\\n## 9 - Spotting Businesses to Buy for Very Little \\n\\n[The No Money, No Lawyers Way I Buy Companies]\\nEvery company has liabilities. You want to find them and leverage them to get a great deal done. In this case I asked Mail2Cloud’s CEO to introduce me to the person who owned their debt. I’d be making monthly payments to him, so this was a reasonable request. I then built a relationship with him and asked whether we could find a way to restructure the debt if I were to buy Mail2Cloud.\\n\\nWhen reviewing their books, pay close attention to how the selling price they agreed to compares with their last twelve months’ revenue. A sale price that’s anything less than half of their last twelve months’ revenue is generally a good deal. You just need to understand why they’re willing to sell at such a cheap price and then figure out if you’re able to fix the problem.\\n\\nGreat questions to ask that will uncover red flags during Due Diligence include:\\nHow long do customers stay with you on average? \\nHow are you getting customers? \\nWhat does the average customer pay you per month? \\nIs there any one customer that makes up more than 10 percent of your revenue?\\n\\n[How to Buy Tech Company if you Have no Tech Experience]\\nThe most revealing detail is the number of hours they spend on development. If they spend only an hour a week, then you know it’s a pretty simple tool. You can assume you’re going to hire someone about an hour a week to take over. If they say they have a team of ten people and they work full time on it every day, you don’t want to touch it. It’s going to be really expensive. So ask questions like:\\nHow much time do you spend on coding? \\nHow many bugs are there? \\nHow many support tickets do you get every week? (If they get a lot of support tickets it’s a sign that the software is buggy and that the user base is not happy.) \\nHow frequently do you push out updates to the code? (You ideally want something that doesn’t require monthly updates.)\",\n",

       "  'body': '\\n\\n[08:50]\\nДоброе утро. Сегодня опять проснулся поздно, но и вцелом лег я тоже поздно. Сегодня кровь износу надо лечь в 10:30. \\n\\nВчера говорил со Stew Fortier насчет вступления в их клуб писателей. Хорошо поболтали, предложение интересное, но я не уверен что готов платить 99$ за вход в этот community. Будет ли эта инвестиция оправдана. Не понятно. Пока я склоняюсь в сторону \"нет\", так как в душе своей и в реалиях я всегда пытаюсь сделать все с минимальными затратами. Для начала мне нужно доказать себе что я могу писать сам, а вот уже потом можно улучшать этот процесс с помощью таких замечательных community.\\n\\n[09:43]\\nСегодня попробую финализировать интегрирование системы проддуктивности от Nat Eliason и Ryan Culp. Завтра надесб приступить к использованию этой системы.\\n\\nСегодня возможно будем смореть с Таней вторую часть Мир Юрского Периода, поэтому врмени на остальные удовольствия не будет. Надо найти сериал который мы сможем смотреть вместе в некоторые дни, час максимум, а остальное время посвятить друг другу.\\n\\nВ последнее время пытался экспереминтировать с играми, хотел заново \"подсесть\" дабы снова обрести умение раслабляться. Пробовал Хитман, РДР 2. Игры мне понравились, они хорошие, интересные, но мне что-то не пошло. Они занимают очень много времени, не возможно отвлечься на несоколько минут, только на несколько часов. Поэтому пока заново брошу эту идею, но если будет свободное время, знаю с чего начать. Вышеупомянутые игры, очень даже хороши.\\n\\nХотел почитать немного этим утром (Traction), но похожу не успел. Наш standup звонок начинается через 10 минут. Благо мой вчеразний день был вполне продуктивный, так что будет чем похвастать.\\n\\nСегодня сделаю немного книги по Vue.js. Потсавлю вечером дрожжи. Постараюсб написать короткий email моим не подтвердившимся подписчика. В общем все что есть в Todoist. А так, буду работать, задач по работе много. ТАк что хорошего дня. \\n\\nКстати, хочу еще наверное решить что читать помимо Traction.\\n\\n[23:25]\\nЛежу в кровати, готов ко сну, но не могу успокоить свой мозг. Думаю о том что лучше делать, на что лучше потратить время. Если быть точнее вспоминаю о проекте the shop for dev. Явно пора уже двигать продукт в \"массы\" а точнее просить людей о мнении. У меня есть достаточно большое количество комун где я могу спросить мнение. А то суммы потраченные на Shopify накапливаются , а возврата нет. \\n\\nТакже думаю о том что было бы неплохо категаришиовать все свои идеи и отсортировать из по потенциальной прибыли. Но думаю это не на ближайшие время. Так как система заметок у меня работает сейчас хорошо и ничего нового вводить думаю пока не следуетт.\\n\\nМозг в последнее время все чаще думает о том как бы я сделал что-то в Джанго. Явно не хватает проекта над которым я бы мог поработать. Тем более , пора бы уже потихоньку внедрять скилы Вью. \\n\\nИ сразу в голову приходит что у меня в принципе есть проект, built with Django. Но сейчас все зависло на создании дизайна , а это такая боль в заднице. Хотя если так подумать это просто золотая жила для пробы новых скилов.... Хммм... Думаю надо жёстче возобновить интерес к этому проекту. Также можно будет натренить много скилов в Скетч по дизайну. Также можно много натрениться в маркетинге. Возможностей много. Надо просто взять время и их продумать. Сейчас поставлю задачу потратить на это час. Кстат надо не забыть сделать тоже самое для магазина, но думаю это второстепенно, так как для начала нужно получить мнение остальных в коммуне. Отлично, план есть. Сейчас добавлю в календарь и в тудуист.\\n\\nА теперь, спокойной ночи. До завтра ',\n",

       "  'body': 'Жертва переноса из Evernote. \\n\\nTHE FUNDAMENTALS\\n1. The Surprising Power of Atomics Habits\\n    * Habits are like compound interest. They grow exponentially if enough time is given. Therefore you need to be patient. If you get 1% better each day for a year. You’ll end up 37 times better by the end of the year.\\n2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)\\n    * There are 3 levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become (identity change).\\n    * By changing your habits you change beliefs about yourself (if you write every day, you are a write).\\n3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps\\n    * Any Habit can be broken up into 4 steps: Cue, Caving, Response, and a Reward. (Example: Cue - You are answering emails, Craving - You begin to feel stressed and overwhelmed. You want to feel in control. Response - You bite you nails. Reward - You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated with answering email.)\\n    * The Four Laws of Behavior Change is a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits\\n        1. Make it obvious (Cue)\\n        2. Make it attractive (Craving)\\n        3. Make it easy (Response)\\n        4. Make it satisfying (Reward)\\n\\nTHE 1ST LAW: MAKE IT OBVIOUS\\n4. The Man Who Didn’t Look Right\\n    * The Process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.\\n    * \"The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise to help you become aware of you behavior. To create you own, make a list of your daily habits.” Then, put a plus, a minus or an equal sign to determine if the habit is positive, negative or neutral in the long run.\\n5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit\\n    * Implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with specific time and time and location. “I WILL [BEHAVIOR] AT [TIME] IN [LOCATION].\\n    * Habit Stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. “AFTER [CURRENT HABIT], I WILL [NEW HABIT].\\n6. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More\\n    * \\n',\n",

Старые заметки по книге Тима Феррисса.\\n\\n---\\n\\n* First and Foremost\\n* D - Definition\\n    * Cautions and Comparisons:\\n            The goal is to become a New Rich (NR). The goal is not to be a millionaire, but to live like one. This means freeing up time to do things that you enjoy, whatever that is.\\n\\n    * Rules that Change the Rules:\\n        1. Retirement is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance\\n        2. Interest and Energy are Cyclical.\\n            * Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary.\\n        3. Less Is Not Laziness. \\n            * Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness.\\n        4. The Timing is Never Right.\\n        5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission. \\n            * If it isn’t going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it.\\n        6.  Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.\\n        7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite. \\n            * It is possible to have too much of a good thing.\\n        8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.\\n        9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.\\n            * Relative Income uses two variables: the dollar and time (usually hours). So, it is important to see how much each hour of your work brings you in money.\\n        10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.\\n            * Distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive criticism, abusive bosses, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we want to avoid.\\n            * Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for “healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.\\n\\n    * Dodging Bullets:\\nSo… What is the worst that could happen?\\nWrite down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or as prolific as simply brain vomiting on the page. Write and do not edit—aim for volume. Spend a few minutes on each answer. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering.\\n1. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily?\\n2. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external?\\n3. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?\\n4. What are you putting off out of fear?\\n5. What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it.\\n6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action?\\n7. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world.\\n\"What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do.\"\\n    * System Reset:\\n                        Doing the Unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic. \\n                        Do dreamlining. Tim recommends doing an automatic calculators and forms at fourhourblog.com and referring to the model worksheet as the following steps are completed.  \\n    1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the rest of the world? Create two timelines—6 months and 12 months—and list up to five things you dream of having (including, but not limited to, material wants: house, car, clothing, etc.), being (be a great cook, be fluent in Chinese, etc.), and doing (visiting Thailand, tracing your roots overseas, racing ostriches, etc.) in that order. If you have difficulty identifying what you want in some categories, as most will, consider what you hate or fear in each and write down the opposite. Do not limit yourself, and do not concern yourself with how these things will be accomplished. For now, it’s unimportant. This is an exercise in reversing repression.\\n    2. Drawing a blank? For all their bitching about what’s holding them back, most people have a lot of trouble coming up with the defined dreams they’re being held from. This is particularly true with the “doing” category. In that case, consider these questions: What would you do, day to day, if you had $100 million in the bank? What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day? Don’t rush—think about it for a few minutes. If still blocked, fill in the five “doing” spots with the following: one place to visit one thing to do before you die (a memory of a lifetime) one thing to do daily one thing to do weekly one thing you’ve always wanted to learn\\n    3. What does “being” entail doing? Convert each “being” into a “doing” to make it actionable. Identify an action that would characterize this state of being or a task that would mean you had achieved it. People find it easier to brainstorm “being” first, but this column is just a temporary holding spot for “doing” actions. Here are a few examples: Great cook make Christmas dinner without help Fluent in Chinese have a five-minute conversation    with a Chinese co-worker.\\n    4. What are the four dreams that would change it all? Using the 6-month timeline, star or otherwise highlight the four most exciting and/or important dreams from all columns. Repeat the process with the 12-month timeline if desired.\\n    5. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both timelines. If financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan installments, etc.)? Start thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow—dollars in and dollars out—instead of grand totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per month. I found my personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for $136,000—$2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World trip (Los Angeles Tokyo Singapore Bangkok Delhi or Bombay London Frankfurt Los Angeles) for $1,399? For some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of Chapter 14 will help.\\n        * Last, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizing these dreamlines. This is how to do it: First, total each of the columns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some of these column totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your total monthly expenses x 1.3 (the 1.3 represents your expenses plus a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand total is your TMI and the target to keep in mind for the rest of the book. I like to further divide this TMI by 30 to get my TDI—Target Daily Income. I find it easier to work with a daily goal. Online calculators on our companion site do all the work for you and make this step a cinch. Chances are that the figure is lower than expected, and it often decreases over time as you trade more and more “having” for once-in-a-lifetime “doing.” Mobility encourages this trend.\\n    6. Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first step now. I’m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-month dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for postponing action. The objective of this exercise isn’t, therefore, to outline every step from start to finish, but to define the end goal, the required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build momentum with critical first steps\\n        * First, let’s focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps for each dream that will get you closer to its actualization. Set actions—simple, well-defined actions—for now, tomorrow (complete before 11 A.M.) and the day after (again completed before 11 A.M.).\\n        * Once you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete the three actions in the “now” column. Do it now. Each should be simple enough to do in five minutes or less. If not, rachet it down. If it’s the middle of the night and you can’t call someone, do something else now, such as send an e-mail, and set the call for first thing tomorrow.\\n        * If the next stage is some form of research, get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of spending too much time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis. The best first step, the one I recommend, is finding someone who’s done it and ask for advice on how to do the same. It’s not hard.\\n\\n\"What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No. Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this. The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here’s the clincher—boredom. Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all.”\\n\\n* E - Elimination\\n    * The End of Time Management:\\n                        We often end up creating busyness (Outlook checking, Instagram, Email, etc.) when we really should be prioritizing.\\n“Effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe.” \\n“Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.” \\nWhat you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. \\nBeing busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. \\n    The Pareto rule (80/20): Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? And vice versa.\\n    The Parkinson’s Law: Since we have 8 hours to feel, we fill 8 hours. We would fill 15 if we had to. When there is an emergency, suddenly we are able to do the job quicker… \\n                So. The 2 synergetic approaches to increase productivity would be (best to use both):\\n            * Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). (i.e. Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income) \\n            * Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law). (i.e. Schedule the tasks with very short and clear deadlines)\\n\\n    * The Low-Information Diet:\\n            This is pretty straight forward. Proposed solution:\\n            1. Go on an immediate one-week media fast. Cold Turkey. No news, newspapers, tv, non music radio, non fiction books, except for this one, youtube (except for one hour for pleasure), etc. Instead of newspaper, talk to spouse. Then do your work. If complete, do excercises from this book. ( Get the news fix for five minutes at lunch).\\n            2. Develop a habit asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important”?\\n            3. Practice the art of non finishing. (e.g. If you are reading an article that sucks, put it down.) \\n\\n    * Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal:\\n\"For our purposes, an interruption is anything that prevents the start-to-finish completion of a critical task, and there are three principal offenders: \\n\\nTime wasters: those things that can be ignored with little or no consequence. Common time wasters include meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are unimportant.\\n    Chapter on time wasters talks about polite ways to teach colleagues and boss to be more efficient with email, phone calls and meeting. There are some useful templates in the chapter.\\n\\nTime consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt high-level work. Here are a few you might know intimately: reading and responding to e-mail, making and returning phone calls, customer service (order status, product assistance, etc.), financial or sales reporting, personal errands, all necessary repeated actions and tasks.\"\\nFor dealing with time consumers. Batching is the way to go ( do the time consuming task all at once (e.g. Laundry, email replies))\\n\\n\"Empowerment failures: instances where someone needs approval to make something small happen. Here are just a few: fixing customer problems (lost shipments, damaged shipments, malfunctions, etc.), customer contact, cash expenditures of all types.\"\\n\\n* A - Automation\\n    * Outsourcing Life:\\n            Sdfsdf\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* L - Liberation\\n\\n\\nComfort Challenge #1 (“Learn to Eye Gaze” 2 days).

       "  'body': 'Эту запись я делал когда лежал в больнице на осмотре для военкомата. ЧИтал тогда книгу про то как хорошо писать.\\n\\n---\\n\\nJune 29, 2018\\n\\nЯ пишу этот пост самым первым еще до того как я написал секцию “Обо мне”, даже еще до того как я определился о чем я хочу писать.\\n\\nМеня зовут Расул. Я обычный человек и у меня постоянный бардак в голове. В последнее время я начал подозревать что возможно я не один такой. Возможно, это не такое редкое и плохое явление.\\n\\nЯ нахожу очень сложным сфокусироваться на одной мысли, и даже осознавая что, не могу ничего с этим поделать. В одну секунду, пока я читаю книгу, мне придет идея написать пост о том как… (Вот сижу я сейчас и пишу этот текст и не могу вспомнить не одной мысли которая у меня была в последние 3 часа. Их было много, мне кажется…) В этом и проблема мыслей, они приходят и уходят. Мысли в моей голове сменяют друг друга даже пока я пишу этот текст. То я думаю о том, что в следующем параграфе напишу о себе, то думаю лучше абстрагироваться от представлений и поговорить о том что может быть интересно.\\n\\nТак как, в данную секунду я дума о том как бы я себя представил, этим и займусь. Меня зовут Расул. Мне 22 года. И вот в течении всего того времени что я пишу этот текст я хочу сказать как сильно мне нравится анализ данных. Не знаю почему я так хочу этим поделится. Возможно, я больше люблю мысль о том как было бы круто будь я хорош в анализе данных… Я студент Северовосточного университета в Бостоне, США. Изучаю Экономику и Математику. \\n\\n“”” Пока я это пишу меня потихоньку преследует желание прекратить писать, так как я не вижу абсолютно никакой пользы читателю от вышеупомянутой информации. Но пока я не перестал писать хочу еще кое-что про себя рассказать\\n\\n23 Июня (неделю назад) я сделал предложение своей любимой девушке Тане. Она согласилась и мы скоро поженимся! Счастье! Эта девушка приносит радость в мою жизнь, радость которой хочется поделится со всеми.\\n\\n“”” Интересный факт: я пишу этот текст, блог, пост, называйте как хотите из больницы. Я сейчас госпитализирован. \\n\\nПричина тому что я это пишу, это книга “Пиши, Сокращай”. Книга о том, как создавать сильный текст в контексте профессиональной литературы. Пока я ее читал, у меня появилось резкое желание начать писать. Использовать знания полученные в этой книге! Возможно хочу писать про исследования которые делаю. Исследования в областях экономики и финансов. Также писать про ресурсы которые я использую при исследованиях. Хочу писать о процессе нахождения, редакции и анализа данных. Хочу делиться мыслями на профессиональную и непрофессиональную тематику. Хочу делиться недавно приобретенными знаниями или прочитанными книгами.\\n\\nДля меня такой эксперимент будет полезен тем что я смогу закрепить или улучшить знания о которых пишу, Вам, читателю, возможно будет интересно узнать мои мысли если вы почувствуете что они схожи ваши, даже если и не схожи. Возможно, я смогу донести до читателя какую-нибудь мысль, поделится чем-то что ему/ей поможет в жизни.\\n\\nНе судите строго. Спасибо за внимание!\\n',\n",

Я добавил большое количество дизайнов, настроил максимально базовый маркетинг и оповестил о запуске на различных форумах. \\n\\nНемного за вечер успел поработать на сайтом личным. Интересно как я забыл перенести ожну запись, поэтому на процесс конвертации одной строчи их моей базы данных занял минут 30. Но ничего страшного, все получалось. Над сайтом  работал для внедрения новой (бесполезной) фичи. Смена дизайна. Главное ничего не сломал, это уже хорошо.\\n\\nПока работал, слушал Мэда :) \\n\\nЕще перед сном почитал немного Нэта Элаясона, и про его метод продуктивности. Очень интересно, но не самый его кристально чистый пост. Думаю над своей имплементацией, так как новый месяц на носу.\\n\\nКстати, сегодня пришел новый кредит :D Им оплачиваю кредитные заолженности, надесь скоро придет чек от США, таким образом, погашу долг с кредитной карты полностью. Останеться лишь оплачивать ежемесячные плятежи по новому кредиту и произошедшим покупкам.\\n\\nДумаю на сегодня хватит деталей. Пора спать. Спокойной ночи.\\n\\n[11:35]\\nDamn, I get distracted easily. I started a journal entry an hour ago, got distracted and did not get back to it until an hour later :D.\\n\\nSave a Retro Tool to Bookmarks - [ScatterSpoke](:/06260036835b4fe9928196ae97d4cb80), they are in the TinySeed batch 2. Seems cool, maybe we can checkout with our team. Also, added [PDF Shift](:/0ae0ed6a0cd64067813dc9e1ff426dfd), which could be useful for PDF generation, both for work, Market Toolkit and for Personal endeveaurs.\\n\\nI'll try to send out my first newsletter this weekend, highlighting people and interesting links I have found, among other things, if any. THis news format of journaling is going to be soooooo useful for this. Furthermore, in the future when a better search functionality will be added to Joplin it will make creating newsletters a breeze. \\n\\nThe situation with my wife is the same as before. Still no clue what to do about it. \\n[12:21]\\nOn the lunch & learn by Varun right now. The topic is scikit-learn workflows. Just save the word [Imputation](:/2c8ff936d5b94d32ad029baca80b98e2) to my Second Brain.\",\n",

       "  'body': '\\n[14:33]\\nHad another fight with my wife last night. Even though I can admit that in some sense I was not fairly aggressive at time, but the level of aggression from her side is stuggering. Don\\'t want to go into much detail, but I ended up sleeping on the sofa this night. She said \"you are going to have a hell of a night before I went to bed\", but thankfully did not end up doing anything crazy, so she just \"sent\" me to sleep on the sofa. Just for the sake of being nice I complied. Even though I find her obsession in sleeping in different bed, fucking stupid. What is going to happen from now, I am not sure. Is it going to be another three day no talking? No clue. Since, she will to to prideful to lift up her ass to talk to me, it will be me in the end who does it. Given that, I don\\'t think resolution to this conflict is near, since I don\\'t feel like talking right now. She said way to many hurtful things last night. More than that, she was way to aggressive and easily aggitated.\\n\\n[18:43]\\nJust finished playing renga.party game with my colleagues on the zoom call. That was a lot of fun. Great game.\\n\\nStill not talking to my wife. She is sitting in the bedroom. I guess it would be wrong of me to play Hitman, but I really want to... Actually, I might just do some web dev learning. \\n\\nThis reminds me that I have been doing some useful exercises today. Have been going through the Fullstack Vue Book. Read a bit of \"AWS: The Good Parts\". Actually I might gie a go to Elements of Python Translation. This might get me on Montolenti\\'s radar. CTO of Parse.ly. Pretty cool company. \\n\\nSo, what I will do now is finish this entry and open up my macbook. I have achoice of the following:\\n* Edit podcast\\n* Fill out some LunchMoney\\n* Do some Vue exercises\\n* Do somw BwD development\\n* Add a few items to The Shop.dev\\n* Start translating Elements of Python\\n* Go through the productiity post by Nat Eliason\\n* Think about Marketing Strategy for theshop.dev\\n\\nOoph. That\\'s a good list. I guess the most useful would be the podcast editing. Yeah I guess I\\'d have to do that first. Then I will Do a few LunchMoney entries.\\n\\nIn terms of work, I think I did ok today. Actually, probably not so ok. I built the Reinsurance MasterFile. Finished writing my goals (actually, I have to make a couple of final updates) and tried finishing the two final, most important tasks, implement delta table into market toolkit and finalize databricks users script. I guess that is a task for tomorrow, cause I do not anticipate I will do it today.\\n\\nJust to finalize a couple of my thoughts. I am not sure what I will do with my wife situation. Really have no clue. As I sead earlier today, there is no fucking chance she will be the first one to talk / apologize. So I guess it will have to be me, but... But I don\\'t want to, again. I just don\\'t want to. She is not a queen of fucking everything! That is just so fucking annoying. I just don\\'t know what I am going to do. I gues that\\'s the point.',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n[09:14]\\nМоя утренняя продуктивность упала практически до нуля за последнее время. Пожалуй с тех пор как я закончил смотреть видео Wes Bosa и работать над переносом сайта на gridsome. Ну во первых эту неделю очень тяжело встается по утрам. Думаю можно попробовать вставать чуть позже, с расчетом на 8 часовой сон. Пару дней попробовать чтобы немного восстановить организм. И ничего страшного что не будет сделано много дел, я и так их не много сейчас делаю. \\n\\nНадо чуть лучше и **структурированнее расписать свое утро**, да и **прием пищи тоже было бы неплохо за скудулить**. Сейчас гляну **есть дли для этого хороший софт**. \\n\\nОчень заинтересовался идеей созданий домашнего облака. Сейчас наверное не самое время для таких затрат.\\n\\nСейчас будет звонок с Конором, потом Стэнд Ап, потом надо будет скорее поправить имена для контейнеров. Короче начинается рабочий день... Это все может позже посмотрю. Пока еще есть пару минут посмотрю на scheduling software.\\n\\n[11:17]\\nNo a huge addition, but found this link to online email courses ([Highbrow](:/aaa7e69928fc46e9adab96ae23085289)) from MicroAcquisition course list. Seems promising, a lot of good course titles. Not sure about the content.\\n\\nWhile I am at it, let\\'s think about priorities for the day. Looking at my todoist I can see that there a couple of overdue tasks. I can focus on moving them later. Nothing crucial it seems. I want to **complete delta table integration into MTK**, **write a short wiki to data avilable in the blog** and **check Yassmine\\'s Cedent Masterfile**. This are three work related tasks that I would like to complete today. Also, **be done with container updates**. If today is successful in this regard tomorrow can focus on the Databricks Users task.\\n\\nFor personal work I\\'d like to **give some thought to my daily routine** today. See if I can make it visual or just make it easy to do. Perhaps **updating a calendar** would be a good thing to do. Not sure. If I have time, which I doubt, I\\'d like to give some \"Traction\" thought to my project TheShop.Dev. To be more specific think how I could apply each traction channel to that business. \\n\\n[15:45]\\nOk, let\\'s see how it is going. Finished preparing mlt clm files for MTK. Certainly gave some thought to my daily routine. Just statrted watching and taking note on [Tim Ferriss and Neil Strauss Talk Writing and Creativity on CreativeLive](:/6964fb2b4068492f9ee3c25289529308) Inteview. I will now check out Yassmine\\'s Cedent Masterfile. Also, finished container update. \\n\\nOn the personal side, almost had a fight with my wife. Thankfully, I was to cool off and make sure evetyhting is fine. SO we seem to be ok :) I will try to finish around 5:30 or 6 to maybe play Hitman for a little bit. Hoping that tomorrow I will be able to have a good [Quarantine Daily Routine](:/cf864d351dab419e89b70bc9c7b6c797) implemented.\\n\\nHave a good rest of your day :thumbsup:\\n\\n[18:24]\\nДумаю последняя запись на сегодня. Looked through Yassmine\\'s file, it looked great. That\\'s good. Did not write about blob data, will do tomorrow morning or later, during the day. \\n\\nНаписал Дэну Абрамову, насчет подкаста и доавил его в Монику. Также написал Ихе в Твиттере и его добавил в Монику. Буду стараться теперь пользоваться базой данных, так как хранилище бесплатное и более менее стабильное (но медленное к сожалению). Также написал Брайнау Агуре, просто спросил как дела. В целом все. \\n\\nДумаю вряд ли сейчас буду играть в Хитман. Ужин и вечер с женой. Возможно в настольную игру сыграем. И кстати еще одно. Я понимаю что вохможно в послежнее время в нашей жизни стало мало романтики. Обязательно хочу почитать на этот счет пару ресурсов. О и кстати в спредшит Personal Monopoly можно это добавить. Сейчас так и сделаю. На всякий случай здесь отсавлю одну идею для статьи, \"как проводить время со второй половиной с пользой но при этом романтично\" (по типу этой статьи [12 things to do with your S.O. besides watch Netflix when you have no friends](https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/12-things-to-do-with-your-significant-other-besides-watch-netflix-when-you-have-no-friends-8babfce35b85)).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It’s weird\\u200a—\\u200aonce your email workflow gains economies of scale, you actually benefit from greater volume.\\n\\nSettings > Inbox tab > set Inbox type: to Default > uncheck all Categories: except for Primary\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Turn off all notifications**\\nYour email inbox is someone else’s To Do list.\\n\\n> This is crucial. I followed Tim Ferriss advice a few years back on stripping down notification on my phone. If I haven't done that, I think I would be less far in my life journey than I am now.\\n\\n---\\n\\nEvery conceivable email you receive can be handled by just 4 downstream systems: \\n* a digital calendar (G Calendar)\\n* a task manager (Todoist)\\n\\t\\tThere are a lot of benefits to using a digital task manager, but for One-Touch purposes, there is one single most important feature: the program’s ability to capture and link back to email-based tasks.\\n\\t\\t\\n* a reference app (Joplin)\\n* a read later app. (Pocket)\\n\\n> So it is importnant those apps function well.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThat is our real goal\\u200a—\\u200alowering our reactivity is an end in itself, because anything that forces you to react controls you.\\n\",\n",

Ну да ладно, сейчас вроде выспавшийся, хоть и встал в 8 с дохренищей будильников. жалт упущенных часов вчера и сегодня. Хотя возможно они не были бы самыми продуктивными.\\n\\nНо что касается сегодняшнего утра... Сейчас доделаю эту запись (продумаю на день, неделю ыперед) налью кофейка, потуплю может немного и пойду за работу. А именно редачить подкаст.\\n\\nЧто касается здорового образа жизни, то хрен его знает. Очень тяжело мне. Тянет на вредности, заниматься спортом не хочется. Сейчас на себя этим давить не буду. В **обеж хочу позаниматься на Танином приложении**, семь минут. Также **надо будет установить приложение по Йоге** чтобы утром можно было ее делать, всего 10 минут и готово, плюс несколько отжиманий и подтягиваний. Надо **подумать над покупкой протеинового шейка для обедов**. И **над возвратом дегидратора**. \\n\\nИдея в ежедневный дневник добавлять ссылки заметок которые я сегодня делал. Украдено из Roam. Странно что это идея раньше не приходила. Хотя нет, приходила, просто не в таком формате. Я просто думал если я пишу запись в дневник и хочу сделать заметок то нужно создать ссылку, но сейчас думаю лучше будет в конце дня делать ревью заметок и добавлять их сюда. Таким образом я смогу хранить ссылки для раасылки например.\\n\\n[08:44]\\nПридумал! Надо хранить идеи для подарков в Basecamp :D\\n\\n[11:22]\\nSent Dan the email about microphones and podcasting. Created a project in Todoist to track our todos. I thought about suggesting Basecamp, but that that is probably an overkill. Todoist and email are probably good solutions for now. \\n\\nThat reminds me. In the good spirit of today's morning goal, I will add a couple of finds here, to make it easuer to track. Just added [Josh Sharp](:/5dd4eaa6bf9b4121b3bd5307b3995ebd) & [Belle B. Cooper](:/912b4c8b368b43879729fbe09c200a35) to my People find. Also took some notes on Belle's post on how to use todoist ([How I manage tasks and projects with Todoist](:/c1bbad1da1eb41c694042ad6c6305807)). I think this is it.\\n\\n[12:02]\\nCurrently Making notes on the Webinar by Tiago Forte and Tim Francis - [How to Work Effectively with a Personal Assistant](:/b511b4fbc4e4483caf679b1516cdb798).\\n\\n[14:01]\\nThis was a so-so workshop. Content from Tiago was good as per usual, Marian had a few good points. I have to say I did not like Tim Francis. Started with a useless story / brag, had typos in the prezi, did not have meny great things to say during the presentation.\",\n",

       "  'body': 'https://www.indiehackers.com/post/what-are-the-most-indispensable-books-for-indie-hackers-e2ec3a13e9\\n\\nI asked over a dozen indie hackers for the one book they each find indispensable to bootstrapping a successful business. Check out their answers below.\\nErnest Hemingway On Writing by Larry W. Phillips\\n\\n📕 Recommended by 👤 Tyler Tringas, the founder of Storemapper (acquired by SureSwift Capital) and Earnest Capital\\n\\n    This is an odd one but I\\'ve found Ernest Hemingway On Writing — an edited collection of excerpts and letters by Ernest Hemingway on doing the work of writing — to be tremendously helpful. Writing a novel and generally being a professional writer seems to have a ton in common with building a great software product/company and being a bootstrapper in general.\\n\\n    My favorite tip is to stop each day when you\\'re going good. Writing a novel and building a business is about maintaining momentum over weeks, months, and years. One way to keep that motivation loop going strong is to find a point when you know exactly what you\\'re going to do next, then stop for the day, get as far away from the work as you can (read, go outside, eat dinner with friends) and then pick up the next day right on that thing. This way you never start your day with \"what the heck do I do now?\" You always have one high-value thing to kick off the day with.\\n\\n    I learned a ton from the book and collected more of my favorites here.\\n\\n    P.S. Yes, this is why Hemingway is our Twitter avatar. :)\\n\\nThe War of Art by Steven Pressfield\\n\\n📘 Recommended by 👤 Josh Pigford, the founder of Baremetrics ($114,000/mo)\\n\\n    In the early days of Baremetrics I found myself almost self-sabotaging the success it was having. I\\'d procrastinate the hard things, ignore the obvious moves, and focus on things that didn\\'t matter.\\n\\n    The War of Art by Steven Pressfield talks a lot about overcoming the ways in which we inadvertently and subconsciously work against our own strengths and successes, and lays out how to work on what matters not just to the success of the project but to you as an individual.\\n\\n        Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. “I write only when inspiration strikes,” he replied. “Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp.”\\n\\n    Show up. Do the work. Some days (many? most?) you won\\'t want to. But if you stick with it, the needle will move.\\n\\nTraction, by Justin Mares and Gabriel Weinberg\\n\\n📗Recommended by 👤 Cory Zue, the founder of SaaS Pegasus ($900/mo) and Place Card Me ($2,200/mo)\\n\\n    The book I find myself recommending the most often to Indie Hackers is Traction by Justin Mares and Gabriel Weinberg. It\\'s a great high-level take on different strategies for getting traction for your product, framed in a concise, clear, and actionable way. I found it particularly helpful because it provides a framework you can actually execute and follow yourself instead of just discussing ideas.\\n\\n    The biggest thing I took away from Traction was that founders should to try and split their time evenly between building a product and marketing it. For many developers and Indie Hackers this balance gets very skewed towards the building side, which is where most of us are more comfortable. But by trying to achieve a 50/50 split I ended up investing much more thought and energy into promoting my projects, which ultimately led to far more success than I would have achieved if I\\'d followed my instincts and focused only on building. Now I always categorize the time I spend on projects into these two time buckets and course-correct when I find I\\'ve spent too much time building.\\n\\n📕 Also recommended by 👤 Mike Taber, the founder of Bluetick and co-founder of MicroConf ($35,000/mo)\\n\\n    The single biggest reason that startups fail is that they don\\'t acquire customers fast enough. Traction explores how to overcome that problem and lays out more than a dozen different channels that startups can use to attract and acquire customers.\\n\\n    Obviously, execution is key. But working from a blank slate is really hard. This book gives you ideas of where to start and provides practical advice to take your first steps in testing each channel to see what will work best for you... and what won\\'t.\\n\\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie\\n\\n📘Recommended by 👤 Tracy Osborn, the founder of Hello Web Books ($1,000/mo) and WeddingLovely ($7,200/mo)\\n\\n    How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. A lot of books come and go for me but this is the one that has a permanent spot on my shelf at all times. As someone who has to spend a lot of time communicating, it\\'s been a crucial resource.\\n\\n    It\\'s caused me to think a lot about potential responses to what I say, and has helped me anticipate responses to statements so I can craft something that works for my audience. I use it a lot when making asks (for instance, in TinySeed I do a LOT of emailing asking mentors for help with our founders — I need to ask for help confidently, but also be deferential to our mentors and their schedules) and I wouldn\\'t be as effective if I hadn\\'t read this book first.\\n\\nAntifragile by Nassim Taleb\\n\\n📗Recommended by 👤 Nat Eliason, the founder of Growth Machine\\n\\n    Surprised this one hasn\\'t been mentioned yet, but Antifragile by Nassim Taleb.\\n\\n    It\\'s been useful for forcing me to think about where there might be fragilities in my business. One of the big keys to success, especially in a bootstrapped company, is just not dying, and one of the main ways you die is through unforeseen weaknesses that take you by surprise.\\n\\n    I try to re-read it every year or so, since I usually find something new and relevant to whatever problems I\\'m grappling with at the time.\\n\\n    Read my full notes on the book here.\\n\\nScaling Up by Verne Harnish\\n\\n📕 Recommended by 👤 Laura Roeder, the founder of Meet Edgar\\n\\n    When I discovered this book I was amazed and grateful that someone had actually written a textbook for how to run a business!\\n\\n    Scaling Up is extremely practical. The book lays out how often to meet, what your meetings should be about, how to structure your team, how to craft your goals, etc.\\n\\n    After being a business owner for more than ten years I\\'ve seen that nothing is one-size-fits-all, and we certainly don\\'t feel like we have to follow every detail of the book. But it\\'s one of those great basics that I can always count on. When I\\'m feeling lost on how to achieve something, Scaling Up contains the fundamentals I return to on how to make a business work.\\n\\nCreativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull\\n\\n📘 Recommended by 👤 Nelson Joyce, the co-founder of Tettra ($57,000/mo)\\n\\n    Creativity, Inc. The best piece of advice from Ed Catmull, the cofounder of Pixar, is that when you\\'re successful it\\'s easy to think you know what contributed to that success.\\n\\n    In reality, there are way too many factors to know which ones actually mattered. To make a great movie, studios have to start from scratch every time. Every movie starts terrible, then they make it great over time through constant improvement!\\n\\nGive and Take by Adam Grant\\n\\n📗 Recommended by 👤 Steph Smith, the creator of Eunoia, FeMake, and nomad(hubb)\\n\\n    I think one of the most underrated business books is Give and Take by Adam Grant. The book paints a picture of three types of individuals: givers, takers, and matchers. Takers visualize life as a zero-sum game and prioritize getting more value out of exchanges. Givers see the world differently and believe in mutually beneficial situations. Finally, matchers fall somewhere in between, with the key differentiator being that they expect reciprocity and operate in a domain of “fairness”. Grant found that the most successful leaders are givers, across every industry that he studied.\\n\\n    It\\'s extremely freeing to recognize that in order for you to be successful, you don\\'t need to take an opportunity away from someone else. There\\'s room at \"the top\". That\\'s why I\\'ve chosen to model my projects and approach to entrepreneurship as an open book, hoping to help as many others along the way. Give and Take also encourages me to think more long term, instead of focusing on the immediate future.\\n\\n    For additional book suggestions, I\\'ve compiled my favourites here.\\n\\nFour Steps to the Epiphany by Steve Blank\\n\\n📕 Recommended by 👤 Wade Foster, the founder of Zapier\\n\\n    I read Four Steps to the Epiphany right out of college and it completely changed how I thought about entrepreneurship. I grew up in a conservative town without a ton of exposure to entrepreneurs. So to me the idea of starting a business seemed like an act of wizardry.\\n\\n    Four Steps gave me a framework for thinking about validating ideas and how to work your way to an idea that could be the foundation for a business. It gave me a lot of confidence to try and give the entrepreneurship thing a try.\\n\\nThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey\\n\\n📘 Recommended by 👤 Trevor McKendrick, the founder of Salem Software ($10,000/mo)\\n\\n    The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a classic for a reason. It basically starts with \"You are the author of your life.\" And once you believe that, it tells you how to write the best damn life possible.\\n\\n    If you\\'re a founder you probably already believe that premise, but it\\'s a good reminder that the point of life isn\\'t where you end up or where you start, but what you do with whatever cards you\\'re given.\\n\\n    The critical message for founders is that you should only think about and work on your \"circle of influence,\" i.e. what you can actually change.\\n\\n    Founders constantly run in to shit they can\\'t control. By fanatically focusing on what you can control, you\\'ll dramatically improve your odds of succeeding, and IMO live a much happier life overall.\\n\\nThe E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber\\n\\n📗 Recommended by 👤 Rosie Sherry, the founder of Ministry of Testing ($110,000/mo)\\n\\n    About four years ago when I was struggling with how to take Ministry of Testing forward, Derek Sivers recommended The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber. It struck a chord with me at the time as I was trying to figure out what to do next and how to grow my business without it relying on me. The book focuses in on ideas around franchises. Not that you have to franchise, but it was more a way of saying get processes and people in place so that the machine can work itself.\\n\\n    From that day on, every time I did something I had the idea in my head about how it would work without me. I\\'d ask, \"What things should I be doing? Who should I hire to help me? What processes should I log? If someone else will be helping me in the future, am I charging enough to afford it?\"\\n\\n    It\\'s funny looking back, as I\\'ve now more or less managed to free myself from the day-to-day, and the ideas behind The E-Myth definitely influenced my direction, even if it was just the constant thoughts in my head.\\n\\nReboot by Jerry Colonna\\n\\n📕 Recommended by 👤 Paul Jarvis, the founder of PJRVS ($33,000/mo)\\n\\n    Reboot by Jerry Colonna. To be good leaders, we have to unpack and understand ourselves better. Much of work is relationships, so learning and knowing how to navigate those ultimately help us do better work.\\n\\n    Jerry is the real deal. Part pragmatic, part Eastern Philosophy, the book is a nice mix of stories and clear actions to work on in your life.\\n\\n        Work does not have to destroy us. Jerry firmly believes work can be the way to achieve our fullest selves. What we need, sometimes, is a chance to reset our goals and to reconnect with our deepest selves and with one another. Reboot moves and empowers us to begin this journey.\\n\\nBadass (and \"Creating Passionate Users\") by Kathy Sierra\\n\\n📘 Recommended by 👤 Amy Hoy, the founder of Freckle Time Tracking ($55,000/mo) and co-founder of 30x500 ($53,000/mo)\\n\\n    My \"indispensable life-changing book\" list is so long, if you sliced me open I’m pretty sure ITC Garamond would pour out. But I\\'m actually going to break the mold here and nominate a blog: Kathy Sierra’s Creating Passionate Users, which is still online. She poured a lot of her best work into the book Badass, which I was fortunate enough to help edit. I recommend it to everyone. But it was her blog that got me.\\n\\n    Kathy taught me to focus on people. Understanding them, serving them, and making them better. (Which doesn’t mean \"asking them what they want and giving it to them!\") The design details she talks about are also great!\\n\\n    But really, it was the philosophy of \"people first\" — explored from every possible angle — that shaped not only who I am as a person, but who I am in business.\\n\\nAuthority by Nathan Barry\\n\\n📗 Recommended by 👤 Adam Wathan, the founder of Tailwind CSS and Full Stack Radio\\n\\n    Although I didn\\'t read it until after I had launched my first product, Authority by Nathan Barry is the book I\\'m always recommending to people who want to write a book or launch a course.\\n\\n    I studied Nathan\\'s work meticulously by reading all of his blog posts, listening to all of his podcast episodes, then listening to more interviews and watching talks from other creators I learned about through his work, and I can say with confidence that there is basically no way I\\'d be a full-time creator right now without the things I learned from those resources. I\\'ve now earned over $2 million selling my own products and have all the time and freedom I could ask for to explore new ideas and start building whatever is going to come next.\\n\\n    Authority is basically all of that knowledge packaged up in one comprehensive read, and absolutely worth checking out if you want to build an audience and release your first product.\\n\\nHooked by Nir Eyal\\n\\n📕 Recommended by 👤 Courtland Allen, the founder of Indie Hackers\\n\\n    Hooked by Nir Eyal has been the most indispensable for me. Lots of books have excellent general advice for founders, but Hooked provided me with knowledge that\\'s specifically been useful for building Indie Hackers.\\n\\n    The core of the book is a model for building products that people are willing to invest in and return to. It\\'s based on lots of psychological research around novelty, habit formation, and human relationships. I think it\\'s need-to-know information for anyone working on a B2C product, especially a social one.\\n\\n    Crucially, I used it to tweak the mechanics of the Indie Hackers forum early on to make it a place worth checking out often, even when there were very few posts. I\\'m also returning to it today, to help design features that make it worthwhile for founders to continually share their experiences and post about their learnings.\\n\\nJust Listen by Mark Goulston\\n\\n📘 Recommended by 👤 Alex Hillman, a co-founder of 30x500 ($53,000/mo)\\n\\n    I re-read, reference, and recommend Just Listen by Mark Goulston a lot. The author is a clinical psychiatrist who became famous as a lead trainer in hostage negotiation for the FBI. It\\'s not explicitly about business (even though it has clear themes around negotiation), but it is about human psychology in the context of why we don\\'t really listen, even when we think we do.\\n\\n    One of my favorite things about Just Listen is the way it\\'s structured. It teaches a conflict scale Goulston calls \"from Oh Fuck to Okay.\" He basically illustrates through stories and examples how when you\\'re at the \"Oh fuck\" end of the conflict scale from a physiological perspective, you can\\'t listen. At the same time, you can\\'t simply jump from \"Oh Fuck\" directly to \"Okay\" — there are stages in between. Then he teaches exercises to move from each step to the next.\\n\\n    I use and think about the frameworks and techniques in this book almost every day, whether to check my own reactivity to something and realize I need to de-escalate myself to make a clear-headed decision, or to try to figure out where someone else is and what I might need to do before I (unsuccessfully) try to get through to them with something they aren\\'t ready to hear yet. These skills translate to sales, customer support, management, leadership, and of course my own mental clarity and calm that\\'s helped me understand myself and other people so much better.\\n\\n4-Hour Work Week by Timothy Ferriss\\n\\n📗 Recommended by 👤 Katie Keith, the co-founder of Barn2 Media ($50,000/mo)\\n\\n    I found 4-Hour Work Week by Timothy Ferriss\\u200e indispensable for several reasons. For example, the book taught me that it\\'s important to choose a scalable business model that fits your desired lifestyle, which is one reason why we made the switch from designing websites (i.e. providing services) at Barn2 to selling WordPress plugins (i.e. selling products), which is much more repeatable and scalable. We realised that the work we were doing would never meet our goals.\\n\\n    Another good tip is that you can build an effective team without having to follow the traditional business model of getting premises and hiring in-house staff. When I first read the 4-Hour Work Week, I was skeptical that you could get a good personal assistant in a non-native-English-speaking country, but Ferriss convinced me to give it a try. I now have a team of fantastic remote colleagues around the world, including three in the Philippines.\\n\\n    The main flaw in the concept of the 4-Hour Work Week is that if you love what you do, minimising work shouldn\\'t be your goal. To me, that suggests that you\\'re doing the wrong thing!\\n\\nGrowth Hacker Marketing by Ryan Holiday\\n\\n📕 Recommended by 👤 Gunhee Park, the founder of Populum ($70,000/mo)\\n\\n    As founders of a bootstrapped company that was constrained in cash, especially during the early stages, Ryan Holiday\\'s Growth Hacker Marketing was helpful in helping us be scrappy while gaining traction. Here\\'s one of many memorable lines I\\'ve written down:\\n\\n        Forget the conventional wisdom that says if a company lacks growth, it should invest more in sales and marketing. Instead, it should invest in refining and improving the service itself until users are so happy that they can’t stop using the service (and their friends come along with them).\\n\\n    So many venture-backed startups dump money into PR and marketing to essentially force their growth, but organic growth through an amazing service/product is more sustainable and rewarding. Referrals and loyalty marketing continue to be the biggest sources of growth for us, as we focus on offering best-in-class customer experience and refining the quality of our products. We now have 1,200+ active monthly paid subscribers, and quite a lot of them have been convinced to try us out from friends and family.\\n\\nHow to Get Rich by Felix Dennis\\n\\n📘 Recommended by 👤 Mike Carson, the founder of Park.io ($125,000/mo)\\n\\n    It is hard to pick just one, but the book How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis helped me to get rich :). I read the book years ago when it was first published, and then I started re-reading it again. He\\'s completely wrong with some things in retrospect (e.g. he thought Steve Jobs would ruin Apple).\\n\\n    But one takeaway that stuck with me from the first time I read it was how much he stresses holding onto equity. I didn\\'t realize how important it is to make it a goal to never give any equity away. It really helped me — I remained a solo founder for a while because of this advice. It made me work harder, I think, because I knew the company was mine and I was 100% responsible for it.\\n',\n",

This means assessing how many visitors we could potentially get to them from Google as a result of people searching for those topics.\\n\\nFirst, go to Google Keyword Planner.\\n\\nThen, take a topic you came up with, and plug it in as you have it:\\n\\n![a72ccf63703d61fe8f53d0ac8bc382ef.png](:/b3c6b79804d542a386cd2e9610bd03ad)\\n\\n> Can probably try to use Ahrefs when I get this list going.\\n\\nplug some variations into that search bar at the top until we find a keyword (it’s a keyword even if there are multiple words) with a high volume\\n\\nNow I just take that Keyword and the Keyword Volume, and add it to our spreadsheet\\n\\n![058212f9ab7909ba40d823b2810c3920.png](:/4a4c94fb8e69447b8c55dad88a7f5f35)\\n![3b541339aad23dd4e208ebede5b4215f.png](:/efe7068cf765412dac0bf5028fc43d11)\\n\\n### Disqualify Tough Competition\\n\\nThis does NOT mean to look at the competitiveness rating in Keyword Planner.\\n\\n![635b8789e205180e0e3b68edba3f6371.png](:/c11df0b48f264b839485f856959daa06)\\n\\nWhat I mean by competitiveness is who else is ranking for this keyword in Google right now.\\n\\nAll I have to do is take each keyword, plug it into Google, and see what comes up. I’ll also use the Moz Toolbar to tell me how highly ranked the pages are.\\n\\nIf there’s a few major sites competing on a keyword, I’ll highlight it in red, but if it looks like smaller sites that I can definitely compete against then I’ll move on.\\n\\n## Step 4: Pick Your Top 5-10 Topics\\n\\nWith your list of topics (excluding the ones that seem too competitive), it’s time to pick the 5-10 that you’ll put on your site.\\n\\nWith just 5-10 articles, you can easily reach 10k visitors a month. I currently get ~2,500 visitors per day from just 4 of my articles, so if just one of your articles reaches that level then you’ll have hit the goal.\\n\\n## Step 5: Make a Schedule\\n\\nBefore you start writing, create a schedule in Google Calendar for how often you’ll publish, both on your site and other sites.\\n\\nAim for a minimum of two posts per month on your site, and one post a week on other sites. If you want to post more, put more time into posting on other sites. That’ll have a bigger ROI for you in the short term.\\n\\nBut the most important thing is that once you make the schedule… stick to it. Lock it in, and make sure that you’re getting your articles out when you say you will. That’s the only way you succeed at this.\\n\\n## Step 6: Create a List of Similar Blogs for Guest Posting\\n\\nYou need a list of blogs that you can guest post on, and that you want to link back to you. The reason we’re doing this now is that once you have your list, you can include links to other people’s sites in your articles to earn good karma with them.\\n\\nAnd ideally, you’re doing this over separate emails (so one that says “hey I linked to you” then a follow up later asking about guest posting), which means that in your first communication you’re not asking for anything, just making their life better\\n\\nAdd a worksheet like this one to your content plan:\\n\\n![bb14ded422df6fc471c9d2e3378fd903.png](:/91d419308db34c3594b253be005f2965)\\n\\nAnd fill it in with the blogs in a similar niche as you.\\n\\n## Step 7: Write The First Article\\n\\nWhile writing it, I’d follow the guidelines for creating epic content that I give to writers for the Sumo blog:\\n\\n* It must be actionable. Someone should be able to take the post and do something, not just go “oh that’s nice.”\\n* Focus on ONE core idea. Think of someone searching in Google. What question are they looking for the answer to, and why is your answer the best.\\n* Think of how you can make it the only article they need on the subject. When someone finds it they should go “whoa I better save this.”\\n* For length, think 1,500 - 4,000 words. More is fine if it’s kickass (this article is ~5,000). I find it’s hard to do a worthwhile topic justice with anything shorter.\\n* Use pictures. Make sure the pictures enhance the explanations--some fun photos are fine, but the point of the pictures should be to make whatever you’re saying more clear. No random stock photos.\\n* Chunk it up. It shouldn’t read like a New Yorker article. There should be helpful headings, sub headings, short paragraphs, bold text, etc.\\n* Links links links. Include any relevant links in your article. More links = more people we can email about plugging them in order to get them to share it.\\n* Link to my other articles. I can’t do this in the first one obviously, but for every article after that, this is important for SEO and for keeping people in the site\\n\\nAs for targeting the article to the keyword you’re going for, don’t worry about that too much. The only thing to make sure of is that you put the keyword in the title. Aside from that, as long as the article is about the topic you’re going for, you should be fine.\\n\\n## Step 8: Create a Content Upgrade\\n\\nBefore promoting the article, I’d make sure that it’s setup to capture as many email addresses as possible.\\n\\nThe best way to do this is through content upgrades. A content upgrade is any bonus piece of content that builds on what they’re getting for free, and is worth giving up their email address for.\\n\\nIn this case, since the topic is different kinds of tea, I’d put together a 1-page PDF comparing their main differences of each kind of tea with nice visuals, and offer that to the readers, using the “10-minute content upgrades” method.\\n\\nI’d put it in three places (for an example of this combo, check out my fasting article):\\n\\n* A page-specific Welcome Mat. Instead of a site-wide Welcome Mat, I’d make one for that article specifically like I did on our Kickstarter Fundraising. This catches people’s attention right when they show up to give them the first offer.\\n* A page-specific Scroll Box. Just like the Welcome Mat, I’d make a page-specific scroll box that offers the same thing as the Mat. Why the same thing? Because people who didn’t opt in on the Mat might want an opportunity later.\\n* A click-triggered List Builder Popup. Last, I’d have a call to action at the end of the article that triggers a List Builder popup to give them another chance to sign up for the bonus.\\n\\n## Step 9: Promote Your Article\\n\\n### 1. Email Your List\\n\\nI know you haven’t built a list yet, but secretly, you already have one.\\n\\nHuh?\\n\\nIt’s all your friends.\\n\\n### 2. Post to Social\\n\\nI assume you have some Facebook friends.\\n\\nPost the article to Facebook, tag some people you think would be interested, and see what happens. You’d be surprised by how many of your friends might be interested in what you have to say.\\n\\nThe same goes for Twitter, LinkedIn, and any other network you frequent.\\n\\n### 3. Growth Hack Reddit\\n\\nEddy wrote a great [guide](https://sumo.com/stories/growth-hacking-reddit) on getting tons of traffic from reddit, but the simple version is:\\n\\n* Find a few subreddits that allow “link” posts\\n* Post your link there\\n* Ask a few friends to give you initial upvotes\\n\\n### 4. Email Everyone You Mentioned\\n\\nJust say “hey I mentioned and linked to you in this post, here’s the link, have a good day.”\\n\\n### 5. Submit to Other Relevant Communities\\n\\nif there’s a good one that you can submit your links to and not worry too much about engaging with then go for it.\\n\\n### 6. Submit to Quuu\\n\\nIf you join the site Quuu, you can submit links to different categories that are then shared by other Quuu users trying to fill their social media feeds.\\n\\n## Step 10. Create a List of Guest Topics\\n\\nAdd a “Guest posts” worksheet, and come up with as many sub-articles as you can based on the one you just published. Add a column for “base” post, where you’ll list the post that you’re getting the ideas from, to remind you what to link back to when writing.\\n\\nThis is the best and easiest way to come up with guest posting topics. You ensure that:\\n\\n* They’ll be fast to write since you’ve already sort of written them.\\n* You have an excuse to link back to the article you just wrote.\\n\\nThe whole point of guest posting (for this strategy) is to build links back to yourself and increase your SEO ranking, so you want to write about things that let you easily link to yourself.\\n\\nWith this strategy, you make sure that you’re giving people new content, while keeping it easy for you to make, and while helping your SEO.\\n\\n## Step 11. Start Guest Posting\\n\\nWhen writing the guest posts, make sure you do these things:\\n\\n* Write really good articles. They shouldn’t be as good as the ones on your site (yeah yeah, I know, everyone else says the opposite, but they’re just saying that so you’ll give them your best content), but they should still be really good.\\n* Link to yourself tactfully. The point of the guest posts is to build more links back to yourself, so add in a few tactfully. No one wants a guest post with a dozen links that all go back to the author’s site, but no one will complain if you have a few.\\n* Get it to them ahead of schedule. As someone who manages a blog with a lot of guest posts, being early makes the editor love you forever. Most guest posters are flaky, get things in at the last minute, and make managing a blog a huge pain in the ass, so DON’T BE THAT GUY (or gal).\\n* Promote it. When you get published on another niche site (don’t worry about promoting it if it’s on Elite Daily, Huffington, etc.), promote it! They might not have a huge amount of traffic yet either so if you can get them some love they’ll want you to come back.\\n\\n## Bonus Step 1: Re-Target Your Old Posts\\n\\nYou might have originally been going for one keyword, but then you start to get picked up for another tangential one.\\n\\nWhen that happens, update the title of your post to fit that new keyword (assuming the volume is higher).\\n\\n## Bonus Step 2: Make an Email Course\\n\\nIn the case of Programming for Marketers, I have a site-wide email signup rate of ~15%, just using Welcome Mats and List Builders in all of our articles (in addition to the landing page).\\n\\nThe easiest way to do this is just wait till you have ~5 great articles on your site under a certain theme, then package them into an autoresponder in MailChimp or another email marketing tool, and tell your visitors that they can (in this case) “Sign up to get 5 free lessons on become a tea master” or something similar.',\n",

Unfortunately, something that my lovely wife said before I went to bed made my sleep and morning much worse. Apparently I don\\'t do a good enough job of saving her honor and pride. She asked me what would I do if someone said something bad about her, I replied that I don\\'t know and it depends. Then right before I went to bed she mentioned that I already didn\\'t do it once. So, whatever I say doesn\\'t matter. Then 10 minutes later I got up to tell her that wasn\\'t very nice I don\\'t feel great about it. As a response I got that she did not feel great about my answer (I don\\'t know, it depends). And \"Don\\'t want to fight about it.\" in the end. Cool... So in the end I an the one who is a bad guy, as per usual, nice.\\n\\nOtherwise, I spent the whole morning getting my blog post on Adam Wathan\\'s MicroConf talk polished and ready to publish. I also changed my email form signup to ButtonDown. Then I started cross posting the post to other sites. This all took a while, since it was the first time I did it in a while. Also, addded a couple of other trackers, most notably, Plausible.io. Hopefully next time I publish, it won\\'t take so much time.\\n\\nSo, I did not have time to exercise, meditate, read or edit my podcast this morning. \\nAlso, I started the bread process.\\n\\nWhat else, what else. I need to find a couple of games for the After Hour drink today. Will do this in an hour. Also, I need to finish data description and put it on the wikis. Start writing the script to add Databricks users.\\n\\n[17:04]\\nStill not talking. Not a word was dropped.\\n\\n[19:08]\\nMaking bread. Waiting 10 minutes for the dough to rest under the bowl. Will then rest 10 more minutes without the bowl. Then will form and put in the relevant bowl or forms to bulk ferment over night. \\n\\nTanya, finished her shower, and within the 10 minute range of my after hour drinks on Zoom turned on Svati... After I said, \"U menya zhe vstrecha\" v otvet uslyshal \"Ya vizhu kakaya u tebya vstrecha.\"... Chto eto znachit, neponyatno.\\n\\nKoroche etot vecher tak i provedem.

During this time I want to be on the sofa doing something on my laptop, something easy, watching a video course, coding my personal website, something like that. During this time it usually feels like I won't be able to do anything that morning. \\n\\nAfter that hour is gone I suddenly feel like I can do work and exercise and all those other things. Since my workday starts 9:45 sharp, I have good amount of time to do work, exercise, meditation, journaling, cold shower, etc. If the wake up time is later than 6:30 this whole ritual might be over. \\n\\nThis is my new morning routine, since the quarantine started. I wonder what it will be like when it is over.\\n\\nI did some editing this morning for the BwD podcast and as I go into it it doesn't seem so scary anymore. Totally doable. The only annoying thing is that finishing will take at least the same amount as the recording itself. I know for a fact that in the future I want to offload this task to a consultant of sorts (or producer rather). For know this is totally fine. The intro music fits perfectly. The only things left to do for the podcast are logos and intro episode (as well as other episode edits). Once that is done I can start the signup process for the Transistor.\\n\\nThat reminds me that I should probably start the process of creating a podcast for me and Dan well in advacnce, since it will take at least a month to get that going. Will message him today.\\n\\nWant to quickly finish watching the Adam Wathan McroConf video while making notes. Then will compile some questions for Clay about the ARM template. After taht will do some actual work and want to spend some time thinking about traction channels for The Shop for Dev. Should be a good day. After work will exercise with my wife and will take a cold shower.\\n\\nHave a good day!\",\n",

Тот факт что на нем можно бесплатно хранить простые приложения очень полезен! Теперь с любыми эксперементами на тему self-hosted (и даже может Docker) буду водиться там. Так что вот какие задания выходят из этих мыслей:\\n\\n* Удалить Monica с сервера.\\n* Перевести ДНС на heroku.\\n* Повесить Kushim на Heroku.\\n\\nТак. Далее работа сегодня начинается в 10:00. Ну точнее первая встреча в 10, поэтому после этой записи пойду приму душ. Насчет упражнений не уверен. Сделать их конечно надо, но наверное не сегодня перед душом. Может позже. После работы точно буду заниматься йогой и ХИТТ с Таней.\\n\\nДруние задания включают в себя:\\n* Редакция подкаста!!!\\n* Закинуть еще несколько дизайнов на сайт и начать тренировку Маркетинг... Это же идеально.\\n\\nТак небольшое отступление. The Shop for Dev, это идеальный Sandbox для того чтобы трениться в Маркетинге! Просто идеальный. Сегодня в обед потрачу один час или меньше для Brainstorm в стиле книги Traction. Продумать лучший вариант каждого из каналов. Затем решить в какой области делать эксперементы. Не забудь для этого вести spreadsheet.\\n\\nДалее по заданиям:\\n* Написать что-нибудь для личного сайта\\n* Закончить настройку ButtonDown\\n\\nДумаю этого хватит для начала. В течении дня выполню последние два задания. А завтра утром начну с The Shop. После работы же немного заредачу подкаст. И наверное нужно как можно скорее приступить к переносу builtwithdjango на gridsome (возможно, надо еще обдумать).\\n',\n",

Сейчас хочу быстро о сайте поговорить, потом расскажу про вчерашний и позавчеращний день.\\n\\nПо сайту, потихоньку работаю над добавкой вебменшонов и в принципе все идет хорошо. Работать с Гридсом приятно. Думаю что в ближайшее время не буду переписывать мвой сайт, а просто дальше его писать с помощью этого фреймворка. Помимо спид буст у других фичей получаю возмоэность повышения скилов в Vuejs. Еще одно преимущество над Джанго это скорость апдейтов, быстро написал, пушнул и готово. \\n\\nКстати насчет этого. Заново для себя открыл Heroku. Думал установить на него Posthog, и обязательно установлю, но пока думаю первым делом попробую туда перенести Kushim. Хочу чтобы этот проект висел в инете, как часть моего порфтолио. Затем можно будет подумать над установкой Posthog. \\n\\nИ если так задуматься, возможно было бы неплохо туда перенести MonicaHQ. Хотя, это явно был бы гемор... Не буду точно, в ближайшее время, для начала нужно хотя бы начать им полльзоваться. Вобью туда Pieter Levels и другого инди хакера чтобы запомнить их дни рождения.\\n\\nВ субботу 18 апреля, в Айкин День Рождения умерла бабушка Вера, и по всем признакам умерла она от Коронавируса. Ужас. Таня растроилась больше всех, все держались как могли. Айка отменила день рождения. Пока, лично я, вспоминаю бабушку Веру каждый день, приятных детских воспоминаний с ней предостаточно. Вечером перед сном мы с Таней выпили за Айкино здоровье и за бабушкино. \\n\\n[08:51]\\nТолько что с Айкой общался рассказывал ей все про BASB, книги, приложения курсы и тому подобное.\\nВчера с Таней начали день с празднований Пасхи, мы с Таней за день до этого приготовили пасхи, куличи и яйца, так что утром это все дело поголщали. Затем начались сборы, поехали в Нью Йорк проветрится в первый раз за несколько месяцев. Очень сильно расстраивает что людей в Нью Йорке дохрена! Дома никто не сидит, чувствую я что планета земля в жопе. Обидно что мы сидим дома, предотвращаем распространение, а всем остальным насрать. Обидно. Более всего обидно за Таню! Знаю как она скучает по улице, цветениям, природе и самому Нью Йорку. Хер знает когда это все закончится. Без понятий.',\n",

       "  'body': \"https://www.nateliason.com/blog/learn-digital-marketing\\n\\n---\\n\\nI’d expect that anyone could take a gameplan like this and go from **zero to hireable digital marketer in 6 months** or less, **so long as you work hard at it and don’t get too distracted**.\\n\\n## Step 1: Pick Your Initial Focus (10 minutes)\\n\\nDigital marketing comprises all the strategies you have available to try to get people to a website, get them to return, and get them to take an action.\\n\\nWe can call these three phases Acquisition, Retention, and Conversion.\\n\\nWhen starting out, focus on being a generalist. You won’t know what you’re most interested in yet, so building up a general digital marketing skill set will help you hone in on the areas that excite you most. You’ll also be more hireable since a digital marketer who can wear a few different hats is much more useful than one who only knows how to do Instagram ads.\\n\\n### My Stack\\n1. Acquisition\\nSearch Engine Optimization\\nAffiliate Marketing\\n\\n2. Retention\\nCommunity Building\\nEmail Marketing\\n\\n3. Conversion\\nCopywriting\\nLanding Page Design\\n\\n## Step 2: Build Your Sandbox (1-7 days)\\n\\nAs for what should your sandbox be, you have a few options. The easiest is to start a blog.\\n\\nIf you do decide to go with a blog though, please, for all of our sakes, do not start a marketing blog.\\n\\nInstead, write about something else you’re interested in. Some hobby you want to get better at, or some area of interest to you like psychology or history.\\n\\n> Perhaps use David Perell's [Personal Monopoly Worksheet](:/42b7e56298f14dc3835239dca29dbc1e) to determine what you should write about.\\n\\nAs I mentioned in my Wiki Strategy article, it helps to be very focused in your growth channels, so if you said “social media” before, try picking just one social media channel to put most of your focus on.\\n\\nYou can always expand your channels later, but if you try to do everything at once in the beginning, you’ll burn yourself out.\\n\\n## Step 3: Initial Practice (2 weeks)\\n\\nThe Bullseye Framework is an excellent tool for finding certain channels to try for your product, but it’s also useful for running experiments within a certain channel. For now, you want to stay focused on your stack, so you can use the Bullseye Framework to run certain experiments within those skills.\\n\\n![147937f9d071f29fbcf92cdb19213278.png](:/8089e381f7ee426c83b4a38c86047c4c)\\n\\nDon’t try to improvise right now, you’re still a novice, and following someone else’s plan will be extremely helpful.\\n\\n## Step 4: Research and Iterate (2 months / till you die)\\n\\nYour process at this stage should be:\\n\\n1. Run a few marketing experiments (usually for ~1-2 weeks)\\n2. If an experiment succeeds, turn it into a system and keep doing it\\n3. If one fails, find another one to run\\n\\nWhat you must be careful to avoid is spending all your time reading and thinking up new experiments and not spending enough of your time implementing and testing them. Many of these experiments will require iteration and patience, and it’ll be tempting to look around for quick wins instead. You’ll have to avoid that temptation and stick to the plan if you want to learn.\\n\\n## Step 5: Freelancing\\n\\nWhen you’re trying to help another company or person do what you’ve done on your own, it’ll expose areas that you aren’t as familiar with, and can help you round out your understanding of the skill. And if you’re able to find someone you can freelance for who’s more skilled than you are, they can point out areas for you to improve that you might have missed on your own.\\n\\n## Step 6: Keep Expanding, Keep Experimenting\\n\\n\\n\\n## All Traction Channels\\n\\nWithin **Acquisition**, you have:\\n```\\n    Search Engine Optimization\\n    Search Engine Marketing\\n    Advertising\\n    Social Media\\n    Affiliate Marketing\\n    Influencer Marketing\\n    Viral Marketing\\n    Publicity\\n    Communities\\n    Other Platforms\\n```\\n\\nWithin **Retention**, you have:\\n```\\n    Email Marketing\\n    Social Media\\n    Community Building\\n    Notifications\\n    Retargeting\\n```\\n\\nAnd within **Conversion**, you have:\\n```\\n    Copywriting\\n    Landing Page Design\\n    Sales\\n    Email Marketing\\n    Retargeting\\n```\",\n",

The reason for that is that before I watched videos and as soon as it was around 8pm, and the video was over, I was done. This time around however, since Ihave finished WesBos videos I am working on my site. THe site is addicitve. I alwasys think, just couple more minutes and I will solve this.\\n\\nAnother importnant reason, is that I now fall asleep later and as a consequence have harder times waking up.

While it has more recently been updated to optionally support YAML deliminators, traditionally, the metadata ends and the Markdown document begins upon the first blank line (if the first line was blank, then no metadata). And while the syntax looks very similar to YAML, only key-value pairs are supported with no implied types. Here is an example from the MultiMarkdown docs:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Title:    A Sample MultiMarkdown Document  \\r\\n    Author:   Fletcher T. Penney  \\r\\n    Date:     February 9, 2011  \\r\\n    Comment:  This is a comment intended to demonstrate  \\r\\n              metadata that spans multiple lines, yet  \\r\\n              is treated as a single value.  \\r\\n    CSS:      http://example.com/standard.css\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MultiMarkdown parser includes a bunch of additional options which are unique to that parser, but the key-value metadata is used across multiple parsers. Unfortunately, I have never seen any two which behaved exactly the same. Without the Markdown rules defining such a format everyone has done their own slightly different interpretation resulting in a lot of variety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thing that is more common is the support for YAML deliminators and basic key-value definitions.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Markdown renderers seem to support this YAML format for metadata at the top of the file:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n---\\r\\nlayout: post\\r\\npublished-on: 1 January 2000\\r\\ntitle: Blogging Like a Boss\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nContent goes here.\\r\\n```\\r\\n',\n",

I've been banging my head against the wall for the past two days trying to configure my Gridsome site to work correctly with Netlify Forms and Fucntions. The issue was that I was not ok with the default and wanted to configure it to my liking. TO be more specific,I didn't want the user to be redirected to a`/success/` page, rather just get a thank you message. Furthermore, I needed to send a POST request to EmailOctopus to add the email to my list.\\n\\nCouldn't find reason for errors and issues. Had little response on forums and chats. In the end was able to figure this out. Not by myself. Collectively, with everyone's help it now works! I'm extremly happy about this. All I need to do now is to move my domain to cloudfare and change my email marketing to buttondown. Seems more appropriate for a personal newsletter.\\n\\nIn other news, it was my birthday two days ago!! More on this later after the call with my colleagues. \\n\\nTo be honest Monday after my birthday was not great. Couldn't wake up, no exercise, no shower. One of the main culprits (I think) is the fact that I couldn't setup the Forms thing, which I mentioned earlier.\\n\\n[12:17]\\nSo, back to birthday. My wonderful wife prepared a bunch of fantastic gifts for me. Most memorable are Sneakers with Naruto painting on it... Drawn by hand!!! Dehydrator and cool art socks.

Почитал и пошел спортом заниматься, покачался, потом в холодный душ. Сегодня намного больше времени в душе провел, но это благодаря тому что постепенно начал воду холоднее делать. В итоге вода была почти такой же холодной как и вчера но тело легче привыкало. \\n\\nСходили с Таней в Холфудс, докупили продуктов. Пока Таня собиаралась решил порабоать с сервером. Поскольку оперативная память прегружена, не могу пользоваться Моникой. Первым делом удалил Личи, затем решил приостановить Kushim. Проверил много ли людей им пользовалось и пока что нет. Думаю, надо будет сейчас сделать Временную страницу для того чтобы собирать имейлы и говорить людям что мы работаем над этим. Точно, по идее это будет не слишком тяжело сделать.\\n\\nСейчас Таня работает над моим подарком, а я сижу в зале за компом. Знаю что это время можно было бы провести с огромной пользой, но я решил что часик можно будет посмотреть сериал и поиграть в Civilization. Приступаю.\\n\\nКстати, вчера в итоге настроил форму на Gridsome сайте! Но решение к сожалению не самое оптимальное в плане безопасности. Придется найти обход. Думаю это был бы хороший опыт по созданию проекта с конечной целью.',\n",

       "  'body': '\\n[08:46]\\nIt is fucking insane! I just had another cold shower. The amount of fear right before was ridicolous. Recently read an article, where the main argument was that the cold shower habit will help you conquer fears and difficulties in your daily life. This is because you get to conquer the fear of cold shower every morning. Yesterday, when I had my first cold shower, it was hard, but there was no huge levels of fear involved. It was just scary. This morning though, the amount of fear was larger than if I was about to kiss for the first time. My heart was pumping so fast, I could feel it without touching. I couldn\\'t make myself get in the shower. This level of fear surprised me a lot.\\n\\nAnother funny thing about the cold shower this morning is that when I turned it on I thought: \"Hm, that\\'s fine, I might do 5 minutes.\" Then a second later, it became twice as cold, and I dropped that silly thought. I lasted 10 seconds max. However, the feeling afterwards is still incredible.\\n\\n\\nThis morning, worked a little bit on the website. Got the latest \"now\" on the page. However, still can\\'t figure out a couple of issues. EmailOctopus POST request, Environment variables and the build process. FOr some reason, some parts of the site don\\'t update. For example, the link to my favourites page. It seems that, the old Django syntax is still there for some reason. Probably need to do some sort of hard re-build on the Netlify site.\\n\\nI chose a couple of songs for the podcast intro, did a little design work for the BwD logo. The latter is much harder than I thought. Alignments, colors, choices, it is all hard. However, it is a fantastic practice. So, no reason to drop this. \\n\\nNow I want to read a little bit of Traction.\\n\\n\\n[16:08]\\nI was just a little angry at Tanya, fir a silly reason. Didn\\'t speak much, it was just buildingup inside me. Then, while my MTK code was running, I decided to watch Tim Ferriss [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65U5byDZ55M) about writing. In the middle of the video, I realized how stupid it was to just build up anger. And suddenly I got this desire to go and kiss my wife. Which is what I am going to do now. ',\n",

You can read data, modify data, create new data—but that which isn’t data cannot be mentioned. All this data is stored as long sequences of bits and is thus fundamentally alike.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor example, we can express the number 13 in bits. It works the same way as a decimal number, but instead of 10 different digits, you have only 2, and the weight of each increases by a factor of 2 from right to left. Here are the bits that make up the number 13, with the weights of the digits shown below them:\\n\\n   0   0   0   0   1   1   0   1\\n 128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1\\n\\nSo that’s the binary number 00001101. Its non-zero digits stand for 8, 4, and 1, and add up to 13.\\n\\n---\\n\\nAnd that’s what JavaScript does. But there’s a complication: JavaScript’s representation uses 16 bits per string element, which can describe up to 216 different characters. But Unicode defines more characters than that—about twice as many, at this point. So some characters, such as many emoji, take up two “character positions” in JavaScript strings.',\n",

       "  'body': 'prevention failed. Even those readers who are leery of philosophical speculation should take an interest in these techniques. Who among us, after\\n\\nThey recommended that we spend time imagining that we have lost the things we value—that our wife has left us, our car was stolen, or we lost our job. Doing this, the Stoics thought, will make us value our wife, our car, and our job more than we otherwise would. This technique—let us refer to it as negative visualization—was employed by the Stoics at least as far back as Chrysippus.5 It is, I think, the single most valuable technique in the Stoics’ psychological tool kit.\\n\\nConsider, for example, a passenger on an airliner, the engines of which have just burst into flames. This turn of events is likely to cause the passenger to reassess his life, and as a result, he might finally gain some insight into what things in life are truly valuable and what things are not. Unfortunately, moments after this epiphany he might be dead.\\n\\nThe Stoics are not alone in harnessing the power of negative visualization. Consider, for example, those individuals who say grace before a meal.\\n\\nSometimes the world gives us advance notice that we are about to do something for the last time. We might, for example, eat at a favorite restaurant the night before it is scheduled to close, orwe might kiss a lover who is forced by circumstances to move to a distant part of the globe, presumably forever. Previously, when we thought we could repeat them at will, a meal at this restaurant or a kiss shared with our lover might have been unre-markable. But now that we know they cannot be repeated, they will likely become extraordinary events: The meal will be the best we ever had at the restaurant, and the parting kiss will be one of the most intensely bittersweet experiences life has to offer.\\n\\ne m e m b e r t h at a m o n g the things over which we have complete control are the goals we set for ourselves. I think that when a Stoic concerns himself with things over which he has some but not complete control, such as winning a tennis match, he will be very careful about the goals he sets for himself. In particular, he will be careful to set internal rather than external goals. Thus, his goal in playing tennis will not be to win a match (something external, over which he has only partial control) but to play to the best of his ability in the match (something internal, over which he has complete control). By choosing this goal, he will spare himself frustration or disappointment should he lose the match: Since it was not his goal to win the match, he will not have failed to attain his goal, as long as he played his best. His tranquility will not be disrupted.\\n\\nStoics would recommend, for example, that I concern myself with whether my wife loves me, even though this is something over which I have some but not complete control. But when I do concern myself with this, my goal should not be the external goal of making her love me; no matter how hard I try, I could fail to achieve this goal and would as a result be quite upset. Instead, my goal should be an internal goal: to behave, to the best of my ability, in a lovable manner. Similarly, my goal with respect to my boss should be to do my job to the best of my ability.\\n\\nTo begin with, by undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort— by, for example, choosing to be cold and hungry when we could be warm and well fed—we harden ourselves against misfortunes that might befall us in the future. If all we know is comfort, we might be traumatized when we are forced to experience pain or discomfort, as we someday almost surely will.\\n\\nA second benefit of undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort comes not in the future but immediately. A person who periodically experiences minor discomforts will grow confident that he can withstand major discomforts as well, so the prospect of experiencing such discomforts at some future time will not, at present, be a source of anxiety for him.\\n\\nA third benefit of undertaking acts of voluntary discomfort is that it helps us appreciate what we already have. In particular, by purposely causing ourselves discomfort, we will better appreciate whatever comfort we experience.\\n\\nSignificantly, though, the Stoics’ mistrust of pleasure doesn’t end here. They also counsel us to make a point of sometimes abstaining from other, relatively harmless pleasures. We might, for example, make a point of passing up an opportunity to drink wine—not because we fear becoming an alcoholic but so we can learn self-control. For the Stoics—and, indeed,  for anyone attempting to practice a philosophy of life— self-control will be an important trait to acquire. After all, if we lack self-control, we are likely to be distracted by the various pleasures life has to offer, and in this distracted state we are unlikely to attain the goals of our philosophy of life.\\n\\nconsequently, rather than correcting the person, the admonition\\n\\nThe bedtime meditation Seneca is recommending is, of course, utterly unlike the meditations of, say, a Zen Buddhist. During his meditations, a Zen Buddhist might sit for hours with his mind as empty as he can make it. A Stoic’s mind, in contrast, will be quite active during a bedtime meditation. He will think about the events of the day. Did something disrupt his tranquility? Did he experience anger? Envy? Lust? Why did the day’s events upset him? Is there something he could have done to avoid getting upset\\n\\nBesides reflecting on the day’s events, we can devote part of our meditations to going through a kind of mental checklist. Are we practicing the psychological techniques recommended by the Stoics? Do we, for example, periodically engage in negative visualization? Do we take time to distinguish between those things over which we have complete control, those things over which we have no control at all, and those things over which we have some but not complete control? Are we careful to internalize our goals? Have we refrained from dwelling on the past and instead focused our attention on the future? Have we consciously practiced acts of self-denial? We can also use our Stoic meditations as an opportunity to ask whether, in our daily affairs, we are following the advice offered by the Stoics\\n\\nAre we practicing the psychological techniques recommended by the Stoics? Do we, for example, periodically engage in negative visualization? Do we take time to distinguish between those things over which we have complete control, those things over\\n\\nWe can also, Marcus suggests, lessen the negative impact other people have on our life by controlling our thoughts about them. He counsels us, for example, not to waste time speculating about what our neighbors are doing, saying, thinking, or scheming. Nor should we allow our mind to be filled with “sensual imaginings, jealousies, envies, suspicions, or any other sentiments” about them that we would blush to admit. A good Stoic, Marcus says, will not think about what other people are thinking except when he must do so in order to serve the public interest\\n\\nAs we make progress in our practice of Stoicism, we will become increasingly indifferent to other people’s opinions of us. We\\n\\nAs we make progress in our practice of Stoicism, we will become increasingly indifferent to other people’s opinions of us. We will not go through our life with the goal of gaining their approval or avoiding their disapproval, and because we are indifferent to their opinions, we will feel no sting when they insult us. Indeed, a Stoic sage, were one to exist, would probably take the insults of his fellow humans to be like the barking of a dog. When a dog barks, we might make a mental note that the dog in question appears to dislike us, but we would be utter fools to allow ourselves to become upset by this fact, to go through the rest of the day thinking, “Oh, dear! That dog doesn’t like me!”\\n\\nWe should, he says, fight our tendency to believe the worst about others and our tendency to jump to conclusions about their motivations. We need to keep in mind that just because things don’t turn out the way we want them to, it doesn’t follow that someone has done us an injustice.\\n\\nBy implication, this will be the fate of our generation: What seems vitally important to us will seem unimportant to our grandchildren. Thus, when we feel ourselves getting angry about something, we should pause to consider its cosmic (in)significance.\\n\\nWhen angry, says Seneca, we should take steps to “turn all [anger’s] indications into their opposites.” We should force ourselves to relax our face, soften our voice, and slow our pace of walking. If we do this, our internal state will soon come to resemble our external state, and our anger, says Seneca, will have dissipated.\\n\\nEveryone occasionally experiences anger: Like grief, anger is an emotional reflex. There are also people, though, who seem to be angry pretty much all of the time. These individuals are not only easily provoked to anger, but even when provocation is absent they remain angry. Indeed, during leisure hours, these individuals might spend their time recalling, with a certain degree of relish, past events that made them angry or things in general that make them angry. At the same time that it is consuming them, anger appears to be providing them with sustenance\\n\\nwe wish to retain our freedom, says Epictetus, we must be careful, while dealing with other people, to be indifferent to what they think of us.

Furthermore, we should be consistent in our indifference; we should, in other words, be as dismissive of their approval as we are of their disapproval.\\n\\nThe failures that many people seek to avoid, though, will not cost them their life or health. The cost of failure is instead having to endure the open mockery, or maybe the silent pity, of those who learn of their failure. It is better, failure-averse people reason, not even to attempt an undertaking than to run the risk of public humiliation.\\n\\nIronically, by refusing to seek the admiration of other people, Stoics might succeed in gaining their (perhaps grudging) admiration. Many people, for example, will construe the Stoics’ indifference to public opinion as a sign of self- confidence: Only someone who really knows who she is—someone  who, as they say, feels good about herself—would display this kind of indifference. These people might wish that they, too, could ignore what other people thought of them.\\n\\nWhen should we begin our practice of Stoicism? Epictetus makes the case for starting immediately. We are no longer children, he says, and yet we procrastinate. Keep this up and we will one day realize that we have grown old without having acquired a philosophy of life—and that, as a result, we have wasted our life.\\n\\nThe Stoics had many important psychological insights. They realized, for example, that what makes insults painful is our interpretation of the insults rather than the insults themselves. They also realized that by engaging in negative visualization we can convince ourselves to be happy with what we already have and thereby counteract our tendency toward insatiability\\n\\nModern politics presents another obstacle to the acceptance of Stoicism. The world is full of politicians who tell us that if we are unhappy it isn’t our fault.\\n\\nThe Stoics understood that governments can wrong their citizens; indeed, the Roman Stoics, as we have seen, had an unfortunate tendency to be unjustly punished by the powers that be.\\n\\nThe Stoics, as I have suggested, are not alone in claiming that our best hope at gaining happiness is to live not a life of self-indulgence but a life of self-discipline and, to a degree, self-sacrifice. Similar claims have been made in other philosophies, including Epicureanism and Skepticism, as well as in numerous religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, and Taoism. The question isn’t, I think, whether self-disciplined and duty-bound people can have a happy, meaningful life; it is whether those who lack self-control and who are convinced that nothing is bigger than they are can have such a life.\\n\\nWe should become self-aware: We should observe ourselves as we go about our daily business, and we should periodically reflect on how we responded to the day’s events.\\n\\nWe should use our reasoning ability to overcome negative emotions. We should also use our reasoning ability to master our desires, to the extent that it is possible to do so. In particular, we should use reason to convince ourselves that things such as fame and fortune aren’t worth having—not, at any rate, if what we seek is tranquility—and therefore aren’t worth pursuing. Likewise, we should use our reasoning ability to convince ourselves that even though certain activities are pleasurable, engaging in those activities will disrupt our tranquility, and the tranquility lost will outweigh the pleasure gained.\\n\\nIf, despite not having pursued wealth, we find ourselves wealthy, we should enjoy our affluence; it was the Cynics, not the Stoics, who advocated asceticism. But although we should enjoy wealth, we should not cling to it; indeed, even as we enjoy it, we should contemplate its loss.\\n\\nWe are social creatures; we will be miserable if we try to cut off contact with other people. Therefore, if what we seek is tranquility, we should form and maintain relations with others. In doing so, though, we should be careful about whom we befriend. We should also, to the extent possible, avoid people whose values are corrupt, for fear that their values will contaminate ours.\\n\\nThe Stoics pointed to two principal sources of human unhappiness—our insatiability and our tendency to worry about things beyond our control—and they developed techniques for removing these sources of unhappiness from our life.\\n\\nTo conquer our insatiability, the Stoics advise us to engage in negative visualization. We should contemplate the impermanence of all things. We should imagine ourselves losing the things we most value, including possessions and loved ones. We should also imagine the loss of our own life. If we do this, we will come to appreciate the things we now have, and because we appreciate them, we will be less likely to form desires for other things. And besides simply imagining that things could be worse than they are, we should sometimes cause things to be worse than they would otherwise be; Seneca advises us to “practice poverty,” and Musonius advises us voluntarily to forgo opportunities for pleasure and comfort. •\\n\\nTo curb our tendency to worry about things beyond our control, the Stoics advise us to perform a kind of triage with respect to the elements of our life and sort them into those we have no control over, those we have complete control over, and those we have some but not complete control over. Having done this, we should not bother about things over which we have no control. Instead, we should spend some of our time dealing with things over which we have complete control, such as our goals and values, and spend most of our time dealing with things over which we have some but not complete control. If we do this, we will avoid experiencing much needless anxiety.\\n\\nWhen we spend time dealing with things over which we have some but not complete control, we should be careful to internalize our goals. My goal in playing tennis, for example, should be not to win the match but to play the best match possible.\\n\\nBecause he cares about us, Zeus wanted to design us so that we would always be happy, but he lacked the power to do so. Instead, he did for us what he could: He gave us the means to make life not just endurable but enjoyable. More precisely, he designed for us a pattern of living that, if followed, would enable us to flourish. The Stoics used their reasoning ability to discover this pattern of living. They then designed a philosophy of life that, if followed, would enable us to live in accordance with this pattern—in accordance, as they put it, with nature—and thereby to flourish. In conclusion, if we live in accordance with Stoic principles, we will have the best life it is possible for a human to have. QED. Adherents\\n\\nIt is also because of evolutionary processes that we possess the ability to experience fear: Our evolutionary ancestors who feared lions were less likely to be eaten by one than those who were indifferent to them. Likewise, our tendency to experience anxiety and insatiability is a consequence of our evolutionary past. Our evolutionary ancestors who felt anxious about whether they had enough food were less likely to starve than those who didn’t worry about where their next meal was coming from. Similarly, our evolutionary ancestors who were never satisfied with what they had, who always wanted more food or better shelter, were more likely to survive and reproduce than those who were easily satisfied.\\n\\nOur ability to experience pleasure also has an evolutionary explanation. Why, for example, does sex feel good? Because our evolutionary ancestors who found sex to be pleasurable were far more likely to reproduce than those who were indifferent to sex or, even worse, found it to be unpleasant. We inherited the genes of those ancestors for whom sex felt good, and as a result we also find it to be pleasurable.\\n\\nThe first tip I would offer to those wishing to give Stoicism a try is to practice what I have referred to as stealth Stoicism: You would do well, I think, to keep it a secret that you are a practicing Stoic. (This would have been my own strategy, had I not taken it upon myself to become a teacher of Stoicism.) By practicing Stoicism stealthily, you can gain its benefits while avoiding one significant cost: the teasing and outright mockery of your friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers.\\n\\nMy next piece of advice for would-be Stoics is not to try to master all the Stoic techniques at once but to start with one technique and, having become proficient in it, go on to another. And a good technique to start with, I think, is negative visualization. At spare moments in the day, make it a point to contemplate the loss of whatever you value in life. Engaging in such contemplation can produce a dramatic transformation in your outlook on life. It can make you realize, if only for a time, how lucky you are—how much you have to be thankful for, almost regardless of your circumstances.\\n\\nAfter mastering negative visualization, a novice Stoic should move on to become proficient in applying the trichotomy of control, described in chapter 5. According to the Stoics, we should perform a kind of triage in which we distinguish between things we have no control over, things we have complete control over, and things we have some but not complete control over; and having made this distinction, we should focus our attention on the last two categories. In particular, we waste our time and cause ourselves needless anxiety if we concern ourselves with things over which we have no control.\\n\\nAs a Stoic novice, you will want, as part of becoming proficient in applying the trichotomy of control, to practice internalizing your goals. Instead of having winning a tennis match as your goal, for example, make it your goal to prepare for the match as best you can and to try your hardest in the match.\\n\\nOne of the things that makes insults difficult to deal with is that they generally come as surprises. You are calmly chatting with someone when—wham!—he says something that, although it might not have been intended as an insult, can easily be construed as one. Recently, for example, I was talking to a colleague about a book he was writing. He said that in this book, he was going to comment on some political material I had published. I was delighted that he was aware of my work and was going to mention it, but then came the put-down: “I’m trying to decide,” he said, “whether, in my response to what you have written, I should characterize you as evil or merely misguided.”\\n\\nIn my pre-Stoic days, I would have felt the sting of this insult and probably would have gotten angry. I would have vigorously defended my work and would have done my best to unleash a counterinsult. But on that particular day, having fallen under the influence of the Stoics, I had the presence of mind to respond to this insult in a Stoically acceptable manner, with self-deprecating humor: “Why can’t you portray me as being both evil and misguided?” I asked. Self-deprecating.\\n\\nAnother source of discomfort—and admittedly, of entertainment and delight as well—is rowing. Shortly after I began practicing Stoicism, I learned to row a racing shell and have since started racing competitively. We rowers are exposed to heat and humidity in the summer and to cold, wind, and sometimes even snow in the spring and fall. We are periodically splashed, unceremoniously, with water. We develop blis-ters and then calluses. (Whittling down calluses is a favorite off-water activity of serious rowers.) Besides being a source of physical discomfort, rowing is a wonderful source of emotional discomfort. In particular, rowing has provided me with a list of fears to overcome.\\n\\nI have become dysfunctional as a consumer. When I go to a mall, for example, I don’t buy things; instead, I look around me and am astonished by all the things for sale that I not only don’t need but can’t imagine myself wanting. My only entertainment at a mall is to watch the other mall-goers. Most of them, I suspect, come to the mall not because there is something specific that they need to buy. Rather, they come in the hope that doing so will trigger a desire for something that, before going to the mall, they didn’t want. It might be a desire for a cashmere sweater, a set of socket wrenches, or the latest cell phone.\\n',\n",

Жяль одиноких людей, свободолюбивых людей. Мне в таких условияз в принципе комфортно. Утром просыпаюсь, кофеек пью и приступаю либо к просмотру обучающих видео, либо читаю, либо кодирую. Хорошо. Если честно, еще б чуть чуть больше свободного времени... Кстати сразу в голову приходит фраза в одной из статьи Nat Eliason, \"Я все время работаю\", где пожразумевается что все что он делает ему нравиться но это можно считать за работу. Утреннее чтение книги, работа. И другие похожие занятия. Хочется побольше такого рода проектов. Надо над этим работать.\\n\\nСразу думаю о магазине для разработчиков. Не думаю что продажа маек с логотипами это что-то чем я бы хотел заниматься все время. Думаю как проект в принципе он хорший, но в будущем нужно будет передать некоторые задачи другим людям. Это кстати будет хороший опыт. Для начала надо будет определить задачи... Сейчас нужно будет поместить несколько дизайнов. Потрачу на это минут 20 макс. Хочу еще успеть немного почитать.\\n\\nТакже нужно будет найти время для редакции подкаст эпизодов.В дополнение к этому записать intro episode. Найти интро музыку и разработать лого в векторе (схожее с тем что уже есть). Хорошее урпражнение кстати будет. Пока не забыл, хотел еще раз попробовать фавикон для личного сайта сделать.\\n\\nВообще я сначала хотел сказать что чувствую прогресс в понимании JavaScript. Уже совсем по-другому смотрю на учебник по Vue. Сам уже более менее осознанно пишу код. Joeotybt хорошее, спасибо Уес Босу, классный чел.\\n\\nТак, что же делать дальше?... ... Уже 8:08. Для начала займусь немного спортом, помедитирую и в душ, потом посмотрим на что времени останеться.\\n\\nПризнаюст честно, столько всего интересного и прикольного можно сделать и сразу думаю о том как на работе сочконуть и позаниматься своими делами. Это не хорошо. На работе дел много и там однозначно можно очень многому научиться. Там очень поможет четкое распределение заданий. Тогда я смогу сфокусироваться, сделать их, а потом заниматься своими делами. Это очень важно!\\n\\n[08:37]\\nТолько что принял свой первый холодный душ. Не холодный даже, а ледяной. Жесть. Ощущения сюрреалистический. Когда включил воду, дыхание участилось в несколько раз, думаю что легкие скрючились отхолода. Член, скрючился :laugh: . Хочется орать. В голове до сих пор озезение как будто мозг сжался. Но ощущения конечно после потрясающие, как после сауны. Всему телу хорошо, приятно. Дальше делать это будет тяжело, но возможно. Постораюсь каждое утро после упражнений делать. По одной статье можно сказать что это не считается если менььше пяти минут, так как на на 1-2 тело начинает привыкать. Но я прошел через такое что с таким тяжело соогласиться :) Кстати говоря, если так подумать, мне кажется я простоял минуту, но думаю что на самом деле прошло секунд 10 :laugh:\\n\\n\\n\\n[Дела]\\n* Добавить дизайны на The Shop\\n\\n* Подготовить подкаст\\n\\t* Отредачить эпизоды\\n\\t* Найти музыку\\n\\t* Сделать Лого\\n\\t* Записать интро\\n\\n* Личный сайт\\n\\t* Вектор фавикон\\n\\t* POST request for newsletter with Axios\\n\\n* Написать инструкцию для Gridsome по local Data',\n",

В любом случае пока результатом доволен, посмотрим что будет когда разрежу. Жду не дождусь.\\n\\nУтром не смог себя заставить упражняться, но это замечательно. Не виду никакой проблемы в этом. Как только просыпаешься не зочется ничего делать и это нормально. Ведь я посмотрел пару видосов от Wes Bos по JavaScript и потом пошел заниматься. Основные упражнения сделал, холодный душ принял. Осталось только помедитировать! Сейчас кстати и пойду этим заниматься. Хотя наверное дождусь когда пройдут первые 20 хлеба, и потом 15 минут медитации. Сейчас сфокусируюсь на дневнике.\\n\\nСегодня у нас запланирована прогулка и поход в магазин. Также хотел выполнить пару больших заданий по проекту Market Toolkit. Так что над своими делами особо работать не буду. Обязательно нужно будет пописать! Вчера не писал ничего. Разбираюсь с проблемами по налоговой. Много времени занимает, плюс еще хочу найти Personal Loan, так как текущий кредитный долг слишком высоко процентный! Это бесит! Если в течении месяца никаких вариантов не найду, то придется просить у папы, наверное.\\n\\nПо личной работе, думаю немного продвину личный сайт... Там надо будет поместить Latest Posts на главную страницу, добавить реальные посты, и синтах подцветку. В финале надо будет убедиться что email newsletter работает! Для этого нужно еще будет понять как работат Gridsome Env Variables. Помимо сайта и writinga вроде ничего срочного нет. Надо добавить несколько еще несколько дизайнов на Shopify. Чтобы этого не боятся можно указать 15 минут! Установить автоматические коллекции.\\n\\nРасслабься, все хорошо. Движешся в правильно направлении. Все будет супер!\\n\\nКстати, вчера отлично провели с Таней время ... Думаю упражнения, дневник и медитация помогают, именно та таком порядке. Сначала смотрели фильм \"Код Красный\", затем умылись и пошли дальше делать свои дела :thumbsup:\\n\\nХорошей медитации и дня.\\n\\n[18:48]\\nЗакончил рабочий день. Решил сделать быструю запись пока Таня делает ужин. Хотел порисаовать немного на iPad и понял что упражнение рисования кругов и линий немного наскучило и делаю через силу, ясно что так долго продолжать немного. Скачал книгу упражнений \"научись рисовать за 30 дней\", но она скорее для рисования на бумаге. Поискал книги про рисование векторами но ничего толкового не нашел... Поиски продолжаются. Еще минут пять минут поизу и... А нет, ужин готов. Иду готовить стол. Хорошего вечера.',\n",

       "  'body': \"[09:24]\\nТаня вчера перед сном спросила, записаываю ли я мвсли когда их становиться слишком много, что в последнее время происходит все чаще и чаще. Это хороший вопрос, потому что я хочу так делать но не делаю. Н авыходных ни одной записи не сделал. Ругать себя за это не буду. Но впредь постараюсь вместо игр делать простую двух минутную запись. Наверное в идеале нужно предупреждать Таню, чтобы писать не прерывно. Точно, постораюсь делать так.\\n\\nВчера была очередная неудачная сексуальная попытка. Не уверен почему так происходит. Не знаю. Точно знаю, что если что-то не поправить это может нам сильно повредить в перспективе. Так что первое что я могу придумать это упражнения, межитация и запись в журнал. Все эти вещи помогут мне быть здоровее фихически и психологически. Более того уменьшить стресс в жизни. Сегодня утром успел все эти три вещи сделать. Кстати, думаю что время и порядок выполнения важен. Например, сегодня утром, после того как проснулся, первым делом пошел сделал кофе и поставил леван, затем лег на диван и начал смотреть видосы (Wesbos - JavaScript). И как бы в этих видосах нет ничего страшного, даже осень много хорошего, думаю что мой Attitude к ним поменялся бы если я сначала по упражнялся. Не буду спорить, первым делом упражняться тяжелее, но возможно оно того стоит. Думаю если я сначала позанимался и помедитировал я бы более осознанно подходил бы к этим видосам и другим упражнениям.\\n\\nНа последок хотел бы потратить парц минут на определения приоритетов на день и неделю. В одной из предыдущих записей я делал упражнение где определил скилы которые хочу выучить. Это были:\\n1. Programming -> kind of doing that already\\n2. Writing -> trying to improve in this also\\n3. Marketing -> haven'ttouched at all (maybe accidentaly)\\n4. Design -> same as three\\n\\nПонятное дело что это многовато для одного дня, одной недели, и даже, возможно, одного месяца. Думаю первые два скила заслужено стоят на своих местах. Программирование это довольно vague term и может подразумевать что угодно. Его я развиваю на работе (Data Analysis/Science/Pure Python) и вне работы (в виде Django, JavaScript course и личного сайта). Тут на самом деле может понадобиться чуть больше чем пару минут.\\n\\nПерое что приходит в голову писать туториалы про мои изучания (Django Stripe например). Это супер, обязательно надо делать. Количество преимуществ зашкаливает. У меня уже есть сайт где я это все могу постить. Я хочу этот сайт немного переделать, для более быстрой работы и чтобы подучить Gridsome (Vue.js). В принципе прогресс который я уже сделал довольно таки хороший, так что чисто теоритически можно продолжить его делать, хоть это и займет какое-то время. Единственная проблема которую я сейчас вижу подписка на email. Не уверен как работает API c Gridsome. Короче, думаю я потрачу на стройку сайта еще одну неделю макс, после чего начну жестко писать, намного больше. Хотя нет, не зочу чтобы одно мешало другому. Писать я и сейчас могу и хочу. Но я к тому что пока разрешаю делать сайт без фокуса и жалости на другие проекты (self built).\\n\\nПоскольку на данном этапе у меня есть еще пару проектов, про них тоже нельзя забывать. \\n**DocPhoto**. Тут все просто. Убедиться что AirTable оповестит меня о том что кто-то заполнил форму все. Пока на этом все. (Можно еще на сайт повесить)\\n**TheShop.Dev**. Тут потяжелее. Так как Shopify сервис платный, тут ждать нельзя. Думаю ежедневно можно уделять проекту полчаса (было бы неплохо). Для начала нужно повесить на сайт больше дизайнов! Потом если честно даже и не знаю... Пока задание есть. Повесить ддесять продуктов и создать approprate collections.\\n**BuiltwithDjango**. Нужно отредактивровать три подкаста. Сделать notes. Найти песню. Подготовить artwork. И запостить. Я уже молчу про дизайн сайта. Первым делом нужно сделать DetailView. Тут работы больше всего. Пока в голову не приходит как это приоритезировать. Думаю подкаст на первом месте а вот сайт кстати на помледнем, в сравнении со всеми остальными заданиями.\\n\\nВ прицнипе, больше ничего сумасшедшего нет. Что касается изучения языка, хотел бы на это тратить немного времени ежедневно. Ну, на пока все... Хорошего рабочего дня, рабочей недели :) \",\n",

       "  'body': '[13:38]\\nWant to talk about a lotof things from this morning and the last couple of days, but have something quick to say. I want to embark on a on a journey (life-long potentially), where I transform the way I learn. Was reading a lot of Nat Eliason today (and lately) and have to say his content is amazing (pure gold). I have went through one of his ([exercises](:/d4523359169a4baeb9c0120279981ddf)) and figured out what I want to learn.\\n\\n1. Programming -> kind of doing that already\\n2. Writing -> trying to improve in this also\\n3. Marketing -> haven\\'ttouched at all (maybe accidentaly)\\n4. Design -> same as three\\n\\nIn the next couple of days I need to do a few things to create a good platform for those new learning goals. One of the main things will be **building a sandbox**. I d have a website, which works fine. I could use that as a sandbox for a lot of my learnings. I had this strong desire to rebuild it from Django to Gridsome (Vue.js) to increase the speed of the website and to put a \"lock\" on my recent learning with Javascript. So this will be key in the next few days. I will attempt to rebuild my website in gridsome at least the bare simple version of it.\\n\\n[13:57]\\nThe question is, should I use a starter, or not? The answer is probably. Not sure if I have the chance to start this today. ',\n",

       "  'body': 'Great article, can be easily re-read.\\nhttps://doist.com/blog/remote-onboarding/\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Introducing New Team Members\\n\\nBefore your new report begins, ask them for a short bio about themselves which you can use to introduce them. Ask them for information on the following:\\n\\n* A few details about themselves (e.g. location, hobbies)\\n* Where they worked before\\n* What skills they’ll bring to the team\\n* What they’re looking forward to about starting their new role\\nA profile photo\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Making a Good First Day Impression\\n\\nWe start a welcome thread in Teams for each new member that joins our team with the title “Welcome, [Full Name]!”\\n![d0db29ed86ec9749dee030d60364cf13.png](:/d1e0437b4ff94c5f953c164d7a412353)\\n\\nThe first post of this thread is often written by their manager or our People Operations Specialist (could be Alan in our case) and includes information from the bio they provided, what they’ll do at Guy Carpenter, and encourages everyone to give them a warm welcome. People respond with their name, where they’re working from, and what team they’re on.\\n\\nEncourage their team members to message them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Providing a New Hire Checklist\\n\\nOnboarding task lists should be department specific and modified slightly for each person\\n\\nFoundation:\\n* Register for Asana\\n* Request Access to our services (email, vpn, devops, databricks, etc.)\\n\\nRole specific:\\n* Set up meeting to get introduced to the code base\\n\\nA new hire checklist is simply a starting point.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Pairing Them With a Mentor\\n\\nA good practice for remote onboarding is pairing new team members them with a mentor. This shouldn’t be direct manager, but someone senior on their team.\\n\\n> Since Manrique is senior and we are all pretty new, this might not be needed\\n\\nA mentor is a trusted guide to help new team members navigate an unfamiliar environment and feel less isolated on a remote team.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Extending Responsibilities\\n\\nOnce your latest team member has completed a few new hire tasks, it’s time to extend true responsibility. Give them a small project that is low-pressure but allows them to use their expertise and problem solving skills.\\n\\n> Again, I think since we are a new department and there are tons of things to do, this might be unnesseccary and we can jump straight into action.\\n\\nFor the project:\\n* Provide the context of the project.\\n* Set expectations\\n* Give them points of contact\\n\\n\\n## Checking In Regularly\\n\\nStay in close communication with new employees and regularly initiate conversations with them.\\n\\n> I think that due to the Coronavirus outbreak we all need to communicate a little more than usual, simply for the reason that some may feel lonelier than usual.\\n\\nThis serves multiple purposes:\\n\\n 1. Establishing they can reach out to you whenever necessary\\n 2. Reducing the feeling of loneliness and isolation\\n Building a rapport\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Asking for Feedback\\n\\nDuring and after their remote onboarding process, request feedback so you can ultimately course correct or improve the process for the future.\\n\\n\\nHere are a few questions to ask to understand their experience:\\n\\n* How did your first few weeks here compare to your experience at other companies?\\n* What could we have done better to make your transition easier?\\n* What parts of the onboarding process helped you understand our team better?\\n* So far, is this job what you expected? If not, what could we have done to communicate the role better?\\n* Is there anything I can do to better support you?\\n\\nDon’t ask new team members all these questions at once. Instead, ask one or two questions intermittently throughout their first few weeks, or even months, on the job.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': '\\t\\n15 Sites like Product Hunt\\nWant to beyond Product Hunt? Click on this delicious description.\\n\\t\\nShiva Prabhakaran\\nMar 26\\t\\t\\n\\nThis is a post based on frustration and desperation to get my product in front of as many people as I could. I wanted to look at what’s beyond Product Hunt and surprisingly, there are lots. \\nI too started this one called ProductBar (Original, I know!). You can submit your products/startup here bit.ly/productbar\\n\\nWith that plug out of the way, here is what I found. \\n1. Slant (https://www.slant.co/)\\n\\nThis one has a complicated submission process, but they claim to have 2.8 million users, so I’d crawl on sand if I get to list here. Decent design plus they have a blog that drives traffic. Win-Win.\\n2. Softpedia (https://www.softpedia.com/)\\n\\nIf you are selling any software for free this is the place to be. Apart from PH and Hacker News, they seem to have the largest data base of free shit across platforms. Plus updated very regularly, this is an easy kill. \\n3. FileHippo (https://filehippo.com/)\\n\\nA better designed version of Softpedia, I didn’t realise till I started this research that this is a product listing site. It also has a blog that gets significant traffic, so there is an added incentive for you to list here. \\n4. Software Informer (https://software.informer.com/)\\n\\nIf Softpedia and FileHippo reluctantly had a kid, this would be it. Ugly on the outside and inside, this website has a blog that has surprisingly decent traffic. Free shit will sell here because while I was there I didn’t see any paid products. Worth a try.\\n5. StackShare (https://stackshare.io/)\\n\\nThey seem to have a social component to their site much like Product Hunt. The design is mediocre but again, user generated content will drive heavy traffic here. The work on developer tool recommendations, so if you are in that space then this might be your golden or at the very least bronze ticket. They were featured on Tech Crunch and when was the last time those guys were wrong? That’s right.\\n6. Startup Tracker (https://startuptracker.io/)\\n\\nWith one of the most unoriginal logos I’ve ever seen, this site seems to have a diverse database of startups. The ones you’ll probably not see in bigger databases. Their filter system is actually decent. \\n7. Museum of Modern Betas (http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/)\\n\\nThis site seems to have the most “beta” level products there is. Has a surprisingly decent SEO score and seems like it is giving out do-follow links. You’ll have to email the founder to be featured since he still lives in the 2000s.\\n8. Indie Hackers (IndieHackers.com)\\n\\nHands down my favourite platform. I’ve got little in terms of direct business but the community is one of the most helpful ones I’ve found online. Think of it as a litter version of Hacker news but with people who don’t automatically assume they know every thing about everything. \\n9. StartupLift (https://startuplift.com/)\\n\\nThis one feels like something my late grandfather would like. The design is 2005 but some of the startups seem to be from 2018. So try your luck with this one. I think the links here are do-follow links, so you might get a SEO push. \\n10. Killer Startups (https://www.killerstartups.com/)\\n\\nThis one is between a blog and a startup featuring website and based on the ones featured, this must be pretty easy to get into. So give a shot and if it sticks then good and if not, then who gives a shit.\\n11. Startup Buffer (https://startupbuffer.com/)\\n\\nAgain, this is a list that I have not personally submitted to, so take the results with a pinch of salt. Their list doesn’t seem to be very updated but there is an upside to it. If you manage to get your product on it, then it stays there for a little while longer. I’m a glass half-full kind of a guy.\\n12. Launching Next (https://www.launchingnext.com/)\\n\\nI discovered them during my research for this post, they seem to be active and I am basing this on the products they have listed which are the top ones from PH and Betalist from the past few days. No harm in submiting.\\n13. Hacker News( https://news.ycombinator.com/ )\\n\\nMostly focussed on CS and startups, this one is run by Paul Graham. Ending up on the first page of this guy can land you some good traction initially. Probably next only to Product Hunt itself. \\n14. Betalist (Betalist.com)\\n\\nProbably the most famous after Product Hunt and Hacker news, Betalist is a go-to website for product submission. I’m personally also subscribed to their email and they haven’t spammed me yet.\\n15. BetaPage (BetaPage.co)\\n\\nClaims to have about 30,000 newsletter subscribers and fairly active. The process is similar to that of Betalist.\\n\\nDo you have anymore that I missed? Let me know in the comments.',\n",

Решил читать эту книгу так как, она одна из самых рекоммендуемых и бесплатная. Выбор сделал в пользу книги вместо курса от wesbos он beginner javascript. Сегодня нашел этот курс на рутрекере... Нельзя не любить интернет и русских хакеров. Чувствую немного сожадения, все-таки человек работал над этим, но не могу не воспользоваться в данной финансовой ситуации. Спасибо! Смотрю видео сейчас.\\n\\n9:31\\nSitting at my work computer, doing work. Listening to DHH & Tim Ferriss podcast. I've listened to it a lot of times, so I'm okay missing something and therefore can focus on work a little more. Let's make today count. I'm sure I will be able to do good work today. Actually, yesterday I rememebr saying that I did bad yesterday. This is not totally true. I did good. Could have done even better, but not bad at all. \\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': '\\n9:15\\nJust moved another Project to the Archive section. Oh, what good feeling it was. Probably overexaggerating a little bit, it felt good :) I finishe my first D3 chart. While reading the Fullstack D3 book, I decided to build a chart of my own, a chart that will show number of words I published on my blog per month. It is not perfect, there are a lot of adjustments to make, but it can certainly be counted as a first win!\\n\\nThat was my morning, I was finalizing the changes for that D3 chart. I had a problem with the xAxis and date order. The date order was fixed, by fixing the backend API. The xAxis was fixed by changing the scale from timeScale to scaleBand as the difference between binned and time series is huge (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48278994/how-to-use-x-and-width-in-a-bar-chart-with-scaletime).\\n\\nLast minutes before I start my work day I wanted to write here a little bit and maybe read something. I should be working on Data Stuff to be honest... Somehow I don\\'t have much done during the work day, both professionaly and personaly. Yesterday for example, I spent hours on researching the tax issue. I think I have it resolved. I should probably right a blog post about it. As well as about making my first D3 chart. I\\'ll add it to the list now.\\n\\nI was just looking at the list of ideas to write about, and the list is actually pretty good. I think there are two things stopping me. First, the amount of ideas is a little overwhelming, I don\\'t know what to choose. Second, the lack of discipline. I\\'d say that is probably more important. And if I was to look at the amount I am currently \"writing\" the things becomes even worse. I need to put this writing block on my calendar. I am not sure how to stick it to it though. I have a history of putting things on the calendar and not doing them. Still, putting some time now!\\n\\n12:28\\nI\\'m on Tiago Forte Workshop right now, that\\'s pretty cool :) The workshop is on Digital Note-taking. \\n\\nJust found out about a cool highlight feature. If you add two equal signs, \\\\==like\\\\== so, both to an end and start of desired selection, it will be ==highlighted==.\\n\\n17:08\\nIt\\'s interesting, I am feeling pretty bad now. The reason is the lack of good work produced today. Rather than beat myself up, why don\\'t I just think through what I could have done better. \\nI know this is not going to be easy, but conider listening to music instead of YouTube. Yes, ther is whole interestin wrold out there, but I think this mighd add to your productivity.\\nA lot of times, not knowing what to do can be a major roadbloack also.',\n",

Хорошие советы у него, звучят как реальный способ хорошо делать деньги, надеюсь получиться их интегрировать в жизнь.\\nКстати, вчера написал email создателям \"Publish this email\" начет покупки. Думаю если они попросят адекватную цену то чисто теоритически можно будет, купить и сделать сервис платным, далее привязать его к сохранению email в Pocket. Dct будет зависеть от их запросов.

       "  'body': '13:17\\nСейчас делаю буф бугиньон. Пытался маме позвонить. О и еще пытуюсь перенсти первый урок ConceptsApp в Affinity Designer. \\n\\nМне очень понравилась идея упражняться в рисовании каждый день, но так как Concepts работает по recurring подписке, то это не вариант. Так что хоче перенести template в Designer. Для этого осваиваю Wacom pen который Тане на ДР подарил. Если пойдет на iPad скачаем приложение. В принципе хочу научиться рисовать на компьютере думаю это прикольный скил.\\n\\nТолько что прочитал статью про Learning in Public from Swyx.io. Мне наривтся этот тип, хочеться тоже больше писать, и публиковать в свой блог. Ну вот кстати, когда я просто пишу, не смотря паралельно какое нибуль видео, очень даже хорошо идет. Что касается писать и учиться я переживаю за флоу. Ну вот например, если я програмирую или рисую, и идет, в какой момент стоит остановиться чтобы сделать скриншоты и какой нибудь рефлектион?\\n\\nСейчас еще хочу больше переносить щаметок в Joplin. Есть еще не перенесенные статьи в Pocket. Сейчас Тане комп понадобиться для ее курсов, так что сейчас сделать не смогу. После пойдем гулять, пожтому в этот период точно не смогу. В данный этап жихни, карьеры, и вообще времени, мне кажется это важное задание, поэтому поставлю его в неки приоритет. Затем пополнение магазина для прогрмаистов, затем автоматическая рассылка клаендаря мудрости... потом еще много, много чего.\\n\\n20:50\\nУстановил Joplin на iPad. Прикольно, все установилось и от синхронизировалось. Сразу могу сказать что печатать на экранной клавиатуре не супер, но вот кстати пока пишу все быстрее и быстрее получается, так что не так уж и плохо . Единственное что раздражает это иногда корректор плохо подсказывает и осень тяжело и долго ставить запятые и точки. Хотя про точку беру свои слова назад, можно просто дважды нажать пробел. Короче не так уж и плохо. А учитывая что клавиатуры от Эппл с русской раскладкой ещё не производятся это очень даже адекватный вариант. \\n\\nХорошо погуляли по Ньюарку сегодня. Также сыграли в нарды и шахматы с Таней. Купили манго и посмотрели на цветущие деревья. Пришли домой, Таня делает домашнее задание для своих онлайн классов, а я балуюсь с айпадом. Смотрю туториал по Аффинити Дизайнер, устанавливаю Joplin и посматриваю в Твиттер.  ',\n",

       "  'body': 'I have been slowly implementing \"[Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)\" (BASB) technique into my personal life. I\\'m doing this slowly, step-by-step. For me, any past attempts to make my life more productive, with Evernote, Pocket, or other tools, have been a failure because they have been too overwhelming. More than that, I did not have a great starting point, I had to design my flow from scratch. \\n\\nThis time around, I have [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/) and [David Perell](https://www.perell.com/), their learnings and writings have been an enormous inspiration. They both have courses that seem great and totally worth it. For me, the price point is a little out of my range (for know). Luckily, they have been putting a lot of content out there. That content is so valuable, it makes me wonder what do they offer during their course. I am preparing a consolidated list of links, articles, videos, and other types of resources that those two have put out there. Stay tuned. \\n\\nToday, I wanted to discuss how I use Pocket and how it integrates into the BASB flow.\\n\\n## Method\\n\\nIt is actually pretty simple. After I finish the article, I assign it a tag, \"read.\" This allows me to see all the articles that I have finished.\\n\\n![Read articles in Joplin](:/9b92ba19ba0b4f52a5d9c6092fca2acf)\\n\\nI then transfer all the notes and summarizations to Joplin.\\n\\n> Joplin is very simple to Evernote, but with a few differences. Most importantly, it is open-source, which means it is free and is being developed and improved by a lot of people. I go into more detail on Joplin in [my post](https://rasulkireev.com/writings/joplin).\\n\\nAfter I am done transferring highlights, I assign that post a \"Joplined\" tag (totally made-up word).\\n\\n![Joplined articles](:/e1a6038a7ce34b3d8b1c648a3712f309)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis is not some sort of revolutionary method of note-taking. This is a simple flow I ended up using to make sure that my Pocket articles are not mixed together, and it is easy to navigate. \\n\\nI think this is the best way of using tags. I never found the use of assigning tasks like \"productivity,\" \"writing,\" or something like that. There is a search button for that.\\n\\nI hope this was useful. If you have any thoughts or comments, please let me know [here]() :) Thanks in advance.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Designing your first personal website ',\n",
       "  'body': 'Ever since I decided to make my own personal website, I have been struggling with the design a lot. \\n\\nAt first, it was about a lack of knowledge. I didn\\'t understand what is meant by mobile-first and how you achieve that. The concept of padding vs. margin was weird to me. Basically, I knew nothing about designing a website. It is a shame I don\\'t have an image of my first website, it looked so bad, it was funny.\\n\\nWhat helped me the most is looking at other websites. To be more precise, looking at the HTML/CSS code of their website using \"Element Inspector.\" I strongly recommend anyone interested in building websites do this. Just inspect websites you like and try to implement some cool features on yours.\\n\\nOne problem with this approach is mimicking too much. When I liked a website, I liked both the design and the content. So when I was making mine, I always thought, \"Ooh, that\\'s cool; I need that feature too.\" I ended up doing too many things, and the website became bloated. I made a bunch of features I did not use. \\n\\nIf you are starting in the world of web development by building your personal website, here is my recommendation. Have four types of pages (that way you don\\'t have to worry about design too much):\\n\\n* Home \\n* About\\n* Blog (all writings)\\n  * Actual post\\n\\nThat\\'s it, you don\\'t need more to begin, it will make your life easier and more manageable. When you are happy, add another page, for example, \"What am I up to Now\" page or book notes, or whatever else your heart desires. \\n\\nThen in the future, when you realize that you need more features on your website, you can easily add them. The difference is that by then, you are much more experienced.\\n\\nFinally, however experienced you are, don\\'t add too many things that will require regular maintenance unless you are 100% you are committed to it. For example, when I created my first Django website, I added the following:\\n  * a Blog\\n  * What am I up to Now (Derek Sivers movement)\\n  * What I learned This Week\\n  * Book Reviews \\n  * Projects\\n  * Photography\\n\\nThese are only the ones I can remember. I just loved the idea of having that space to fill, but pretty quickly, it became overwhelming, and I ended up not doing anything. Only once I\\'ve started removing things, I began to use other features. \\n\\n> I think this is a good approach to life also. Don\\'t try to take on too many things at once.\\n\\nOnly add more things when you already have something to show for, and only if you know, you will keep it going. Right now, I only have the Blog and the Now page, where the latter is updated once a month. This way, I\\'m not pressured to do other things and can focus on something more substantial.\\n\\nIn the future, I want to add a photography page, because it is something I want to become better at, and am currently learning. However, unless I am consistent with it, I won\\'t \"burden\" myself by adding it to my website.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIf you are just starting on a Web Development path and are starting with your website, congratulations, you have a fantastic road ahead of you. Not to get discouraged pretty quickly, stick to simple things.\\n\\n1. Keep content to a minimum:\\n  * Have a welcome page (home)\\n  * Have a page where you talk about yourself (about)\\n  * Create a blog with a list of all the posts and a detailed view for each post (blog)\\n\\n2. Keep your design simple.\\n  * Start with pure and simple CSS. Make sure it looks good on the phone first.\\n  * Move one step at a time.\\n\\n3. Add new things as a means of learning something new.\\n  * Learning new things won\\'t become any easier (in a good way), but the base things you did before will become a breeze.\\n\\nI hope this was at least a little bit useful. Actually, I hope this made at least a little bit of sense.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to shoot me a message at one of the links on the about page. \\n\\nThanks for reading.',\n",

I learned a ton when building it.\\n\\nI am shutting it down because I don't see any income (or knowledge) generating the future for this product. Many things are stopping it from being profitable. This is ok. I know I can back to it in the future any time I want. In fact, I know I will, for the purposes of learning frontend skills.\\n\\nI've been a part of the IH community for a while now and understand that this is a healthy thing to do. The only way to find the perfect project is to go through them one by one, rather than fixating for too long. \\n\\nI am so grateful to Kushim for everything it taught, I wish everyone gets a chance to experience that. Coming up with an idea and coding something up, putting it on the server, and sharing with the world is an incredible experience. It doesn't matter if it fails, the novelty of the skills you have is totally worth it. \\n\\nFor the sake of self-accountability, I want to take a second to remember the technical skills I learned building this product.\\n\\n* User Authentication (with Django)\\n* Postgres DB Management\\n* Setting up the server (NGINX, Gunicorn)\\n* Basic SEO (meta tags, twitter cards)\\n* Basic Web Design (TailwindCSS)\\n\\nIf you want to test out the project, here is the link -> https://kushim.io. It will be active for a long time, I don't have any reason to delete it of my server, the traffic is minuscule. If I sell the domain, the same site will also be available at https://kushim.rasulkieev.com.\\n\\nThanks for reading. Have a beautiful day, and stay safe.\\n\\nBest,\\nRasul\\n\\n\",\n",

He also gained 25 pounds, became depressed, moody, lethargic and completely lost his sex drive.\\n\\n---\\n\\nVertical coherence is the largest predictor of motivation that I’ve found. If I can see a clear line between the tasks I am working on today and a bigger future that aligns with my values, I find it much easier to get to work.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe next thing you’re going to do is list the number one most important priority you have today. If you start the day with ten priorities, you’re likely to get none of them done. I find, if you start with one thing you absolutely must do, you’ll always get it done.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe most important ingredient to having a morning routine that works is to customize it for yourself. To reiterate Bruce Lee: “Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own.”\\n\\n---\\n\\nSmall win ideas:\\n* Food\\n\\t* Drink a glass of water and make coffee\\n\\t* Eat a Healthy Breakfast\\n* Intellectual\\n\\t* Read an Article\\n\\t* [Write down 10 ideas](http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/)\\n\\t* Listen to a Book or Podcast\\n* Fitness/Stretching\\n\\t* 4 Minute Stretching Routine for Desk Sitters\\n\\t* [7 Minute Morning Yoga for Flexibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRsC1YdXqOc)\\n* Meditaion / Mindfullness\\n\\t* [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/)\\n* Review\\n\\t* [Create and Review a 25-Year Vision](https://taylorpearson.me/planning/)\\n\\t* [Script out and Review Your Ideal Day](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2013/08/what-is-a-perfect-day-for-you/)\\n\\t* [Determine and Review Your Operating Principles](https://taylorpearson.me/principles/)\\n* Journal and Plan\\n\\t* Gratitude Journal\\n\\t* Prioritize - What would make today great is…\\n\\t* Affiramtions - I believe…\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t',\n",

Working out for a few hours per week is probably very beneficial. Working out for sixty hours per week can be extremely damaging to your long-term health. It is simply too high of a dose.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1. Prioritize Tasks by Energy Level\\n\\nOne way to work smarter, not harder is to plan your days and weeks around your natural rhythms. If you’re a morning person, don’t leave the most important work for the afternoon and if you’re a night owl, don’t feel guilty about sleeping later and staying up at night to get your work done.\\n\\nI started to break my to-do lists into three sections and sort it by energy levels:\\n\\nI typically do about 10–15 hours of high-level work each week, another 10–15 of medium energy work, and another 10–15 of low energy, administrative work.\\n\\n![243f7ede79cb9fff8d21b2912387548f.png](:/a6d1378291c34d2982b5dcb82abb5cb6)\\n\\n---\\n\\n“Use courage and wisdom, not labor, to make money.”\\u200a—\\u200aNassim Taleb\\n\\n---\\n\\nInstead of sharing a new idea, we keep it to ourselves because we’re afraid what people will think.\\n\\nThere is no one way to apply more courage to your work.\\n\\nMaybe, for you, courage is choosing to work less because we are confident in our own productivity time. Even if that means having a 5-hour work day or 20 hour work week.\\n\\nMaybe it’s having a difficult conversation with someone at work.\\n\\nBut, for all of us, being courageous is the real hard work we need to do, rather than just “clocking in more time.”\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'The beginning of 2020 was not perfect for me. Right at the start of 2020 (literally, first hour), I started feeling a little sick. On the next day, I woke up with a high fever. Around the 10th of January, with a lot of help from my wife, I was able to fight the disease. \\n\\n> I think that my boss got sick because of that and was not able to spend time with his newborn child. I feel terrible because of that. So, Alan, if you are reading this, I am sorry. \\n\\nThen, the rest of the month I spent in a mild depression. It was the worst mood and the hardest time I\\'ve had in my life, psychologically. To be honest with you, I still don\\'t fully understand why. I have been under mild stress due to a whole bunch of reasons, the main one is financial instability, of course. I have a feeling this might be one of the most popular reasons for sadness. This has been going on for a while, but mostly my mood has been fine, more or less. I guess something happened that sent me to the rock bottom, psychologically speaking.\\n\\nI am okay now. In fact, I am better than before. Much better. I now wake up super early, which I was never able to do. I exercise almost every morning. I work on my personal projects before I go to work. I eat healthy foods. I have a great relationship with my wife. Everything seems to be going fine now.\\n\\nIn this post, I wanted to share some of my reflections on the depressive state that I went through. I\\'d like to share some of my thoughts that were running through my head and what helped me get over the sadness. I hope this is useful.\\n\\n## Common Advice\\nI want to start with a brief list of things that one might find when searching the web for \"How to deal with Depression.\"\\n\\n\\n### Exercise\\nIt can be very annoying to search online for a solution and get the same advice over and over. Exercise, exercise, exercise.\\n\\nWill you stop, please? Look, I know exercise is good. In fact, I like to exercise, it makes me feel good. But, when you are depressed, you don\\'t want to exercise. You really don\\'t. If, during my depressive state, I do have a glimpse of hope and light, I will exercise. Will it make me feel better? Probably. Will it solve my bigger problem? It won\\'t! It won\\'t because solutions like exercise work only when done regularly. You can\\'t expect a person dealing with mood swings to exercise regularly. It just does not work that way.\\nWhat will happen to a depressed person who was told to exercise, but failed to do that? It will only lead to a worse condition.\\n\\nExercise is great. Everyone knows exercise is great for your body and mind. However, it is only great for a person who is not struggling with too many things at ones. Please, stop recommending people exercise when they are depressed. It is not a solution to the problem. \\n\\n### Meditate\\n\\nThe problem here is the same. I know it is good for me. In my case, I actually enjoy it. But in times of great sadness, I can\\'t make myself do it.\\n\\n\\n## Fighting the battle\\n\\nEvery single fucking day, I had to battle myself, my mood. Most of the time, I win the battle, but many times I don\\'t. The only solution to this is not to have one at all. If you think about it, no human can win each time they fight something. It is impossible, you won\\'t have the stamina to do that, and eventually, you give up. So, the only solution that comes to mind is not to have the battle at all. \\n\\nThe only problem with that is that it is easy to say that, but hard to do. When you are depressed, it doesn\\'t feel like you have much control over your body, over your thoughts. So what should you do?\\n\\n### Go easy on yourself\\n\\nLook, I\\'m no doctor, I don\\'t know what the cause for your sadness/depression is. For me, it was that I took on too many projects, too many responsibilities. \\n\\nOne thing that helped me was going easy on myself. After a couple of days of beating myself up, I decided to drop half of my projects, half of my attempt to build good habits, it was too much.\\n\\nI made sure to enjoy junk food, even after finishing it. I tried really hard not to worry about watching too much television. I stopped worrying about missing exercise for a week. I decided to drop all my worries and enjoy whatever it is I was doing. In a lot of cases, it was nothing, just sitting on a sofa eating junk food.\\n\\nThat helped me a lot. Now, I\\'m back on track to build some good habits, but this time I\\'m making sure not to overdo it. Taking a step at a time.\\n\\n### Other people\\n\\nAnother useful tool that helped me get my mood, my desire to do things back was listening to other people. In my case, those people were Jordan Peterson and DHH. \\n\\nJordan Peterson has some incredibly useful and insightful thoughts on leaving a good life and on depression specifically. A couple of videos of his lectures I found on YouTube have been crucial in my recovery.\\n\\nDHH is one of my role models. I find that most of his thoughts and beliefs that he shares align with mine. Whenever I lose track of who I am and what is important for me, I will listen to one of his podcasts, and it will almost certainly make me feel better and more strong.\\n\\nI recommend that you find people that inspire you, and that makes you remember who you are and what it means to be a good person.\\n\\n## Some resources that helped me\\n\\n### Jordan Peterson - [How To Deal With Depression | Powerful Motivational Speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm_2zmX6Akc)\\n\\n#### 5:00 - 7:00\\n* You want to constraint the negative event to the smallest domain possible.\\n\\n> It is going to be hard, no question about that. But it is crucial to try your best to limit the damage a negative event has. For example, when your recent side project had no traction, it does not mean you are a failure. It only means that this idea is not the one to bring you success.\\n\\n> Another example of this is talking to your partner. When you argue, try your best to limit the exposure to a minimum. Instead of saying, \"you always do this,\" say, \"can you please try doing this next time.\" If you are nice about it, they might listen. Whatever the outcome is, it is a ton better than blaming them for everything.\\n\\n#### 14:00 - 18:00\\n* Have a routine.\\n* Eat breakfast, eat well, enough.\\n* Have family (parents, partner, kids) in good standing. \\n  * Listen to your partner, they will tell what they want.\\n \\n  \\n### Jordan Peterson - [Advice For People With Depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c9Uu5eILZ8)\\n\\n#### 01:00 - 03:00\\n* Having a job (a necessary repetitive task) is helpful. It will get you in a routine. If you don\\'t have that, you don\\'t have a good reason to go to bed. You don\\'t have a good reason to wake up. That is big to cause depression in a lot of people. \\n\\n> Not having a set schedule for sleep and other things mess up your Circadian rhythms.\\n\\n* Positive emotions are not that secret. Having a calling, accomplishing small things will make you happy. Experience makes people happy, much more than purchases do.\\n\\n#### 03:00 - 05:00\\n\\n> Having many problems at once makes you almost impossible to help. For example, if you have no job, friends, and relationship. Dealing with one problem is not helpful, because others pull you down. \\n\\n* Get a job, even if not a dream job.\\n* Get out there and talk to people.\\n* Become more intimate with someone.\\n\\n#### 4:00\\n* Learn to negotiate with yourself. \"What are you willing to do?\" What you should be willing to do is something small. Assuming you want to do better, there is always something small you can do to get closer to your final goal. If you repeat that often enough, those small going compound into something incredible.\\n\\n\\n### DHH  - [Developer on Fire Interview]()\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'Nate,\\n\\nI want to thank you and the team for all the work you do on teaching people various technologies. \\n\\nI just purchased my first book from Newline, \"Fullstack D3\" by Amelia Wattenberger. I am going through the second chapter now. \\n\\nI purchased a physical copy of the book on Amazon because I loved the cover. Additionally, I knew that I will be using it while coding, so it would be great to have it by my side. While going through the chapters, I realize there is a lot of good theory and generally a lot of good content to read.\\n\\nUnfortunately, with the limited amount of time I have in the mornings, I can only go through the code, not the theory itself. I love to read while on my way to my full-time job, but this is a heavy book and is not very feasible to take with me every day.\\n\\nI understand that physical versions and printed copies are sold separately. But still, could I ask if it would be possible to share a pdf version of this fantastic book? I would really appreciate it. \\n\\nThanks a ton in advance.\\n\\nBest,\\nRasul Kireev',\n",

       "  'title': 'Displaying latest posts on your home page - get_context_data',\n",
       "  'body': 'When I was first learning Django, I decided to build a personal website first. I took [sivers.org](https://sivers.org) as an example. I loved its simplicity and directness. \\n\\nI first created a blog app within my project. Then created the URL structure. `/writings/` listed all my posts and `/writings/<slug>` was for a specific post. Everything was working correctly. The next challenge was to get the latest n posts to my home page. That took me at least a week to figure out. The worst thing was that the way I did it was way too complicated. I used custom template tags to achieve that. \\n\\nI wanted to write a post about it back then. Thank God I didn\\'t. Last week I figured out a much simpler way to do that. This is what this post is about. \\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n### Blog app\\n\\nLet\\'s say you have a simple project setup with two apps, `pages` for static pages, and a blog for all the posts that you write.\\n\\nYou blog app contains a simple post model, with the following variables:\\n\\n```python\\nclass Post(MentionableMixin, models.Model):\\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\\n    body = models.TextField()\\n    date = models.DateTimeField()\\n    category = models.CharField(max_length=100)\\n\\n    # if you are not sure what the code below does, don\\'t worry about it.\\n    def __str__(self):\\n        return \"(Draft = \" + str(self.draft) + \") \" + self.category + \\': \\' + self.title\\n\\n    def get_absolute_url(self) -> str:\\n        return reverse(\\'post\\', kwargs={\\'slug\\': self.slug})\\n```\\n\\nNext, you have two views, one for a list of posts and one for the post itself.\\n\\n```python\\nclass PostListView(ListView):\\n    model = Post\\n    template_name = \\'writings/posts/all-posts.html\\'\\n    ordering = \\'-date\\'\\n\\nclass PostDetailView(DetailView):\\n    model = Post\\n    template_name = \\'writings/posts/post.html\\'\\n```\\n\\nYou have those views attached to specific URLs like so:\\n\\n```python\\nurlpatterns = [\\n    path(\\'posts\\', PostListView.as_view(), name=\\'all_posts\\'),\\n    path(\\'posts/<int:pk>\\', PostDetailView.as_view(), name=\\'post\\'),\\n]\\n```\\n\\nThis is your blog app. The very plane, almost identical to other \"Make your blog tutorials\":\\n* by [skysilk](https://www.skysilk.com/blog/2017/how-to-make-a-blog-with-django/)\\n* by [djanorocks](https://www.djangorocks.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-basic-blog-in-django/)\\n* by [codespeedy](https://www.codespeedy.com/how-to-create-a-basic-blog-website-in-django/)\\n\\nIf you are starting out I strongly recommend going through [DjangoGirls](https://djangogirls.org/) [tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) and [Will Vincent\\'s tutorials](https://wsvincent.com/) and [books](https://learndjango.com/books/).\\n\\n### Pages app\\n\\nIf you have read basic tutorials by [William Vincent](https://wsvincent.com/), then this will be familiar. If you haven\\'t, I strongly suggest it. He has a lot of posts on his [website](https://wsvincent.com). Even better are his [books on Django](https://learndjango.com/books/). Those have been a priceless resource for me when I was learning Django (I still am). \\n\\nIn any case, for the static pages, William suggests to set up a \\'pages\\' app. No need to write models. You will have views and URL routing. \\n\\nYour project urls.py will route to the pages app like so:\\n\\n```python\\nurlpatterns = [\\n    path(\\'\\', HomePageView.as_view(), name=\\'home\\'),\\n    path(\\'about/\\', AboutPageView.as_view(), name=\\'about\\'),\\n]\\n```\\n\\nAnd your pages app views.py will look like the so:\\n\\n```python\\nclass HomePageView(TemplateView):\\n    template_name = \\'home.html\\'\\n\\nclass AboutPageView(TemplateView):\\n    template_name = \\'about.html\\'\\n```\\n\\n## Getting context\\n\\nAt last, we can actually work on the problem at hand. \\n\\nAll you have to do is:\\n1) import the Post model from the blog app \\n2) add get_context method to your homepage TemplateView\\n\\nThat\\'s it. Now your views.py looks like this:\\n\\n```python\\nclass HomePageView(TemplateView):\\n    template_name = \\'home.html\\'\\n\\n    # new \\n    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):\\n        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)\\n        context[\\'posts\\'] = Post.objects.filter(draft=False).order_by(\\'-date\\')[0:5]\\n\\n        return context\\n```\\n\\nWhat you can do now is use the name you\\'ve given to the new context in the templates. In you home.html all you have to do is to add a for loop like so:\\n\\n```python\\n{% for post in posts %}\\n  <a href=\"{% url \\'post\\' post.pk %}\">\\n      <p>{{ post.title }}</p>\\n  </a>\\n{% endfor %}\\n```\\n\\nYou will now get the list of all the posts. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBefore I used a very complicated method to achieve the same result, I honestly don\\'t even want to tell anyone about it. This is a much more straight forward, much more elegant solution. It requires much less additional code written.\\n\\nOne thing I felt when I was writing this post is a worry that people are reading this need more context (oun intended). I think I willwrite a \"Definitive guide to start a Django project.\" That way, in the future, I can always refer to the structure that already exists, as opposed to starting fresh every single time. \\n\\nIf you agree, please let me know at my [email](mailto:kireevr1996@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](). If you disagree, still, please let me know. If you have any questions, please let me know.\\n\\nI hope this was helpful. Thanks for reading.',\n",

I have successfully set up a shop on Shopify. It still amazes me that it is so easy to set up a shop.\\n\\nQuick note: Since I am a huge Django fan. I tried to set up the shop programmatically, using an open-source project, Saleor, which seems pretty cool and uses cool tech. Quickly I realized it is never going to happen. Which is why I decided to go with Shopify.\\n\\nI got the basic design finished and am in the process of adding a few different products. You are more than welcome to give it a look and share your opinion. In fact, I would be extremely grateful if you do that. (https://theshop.dev)\\n\\nOnce I get a few orders (hopefully I do) and at least 10 different products, I can think about launching on ProductHunt and other similar places. \\n\\nFinal note: I would like to that this awesome community for all the motivation and inspiration. More than that, I would really like to thank all of you guys and girls for your activity within this community. Every time I see people helping each other, I think that perhaps we are all going to be ok. \\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this. I hope you have a wonderful day!',\n",

       "  'body': 'alexanderisora@gmail.com\\n\\nAlexander Isora\\n\\nAlexander,\\n\\nThank you so much for submitting your project on \"Built with Django\". This means a lot. \\n\\nEvery time someone submits a project, I get amazed by what things can be done with Django. Unicorn Platform seems crazy good. The least I can say is that this is an extremely high-quality product.\\n\\nI have a few follow up questions if you don\\'t mind.\\n\\n1. Are you okay with me sharing your details for the project you submitted? For example, adding your email, twitter, or Github account below the project description (or in a DetailView).\\n\\n2. Would you be willing to share some further information about your project? For example, the version of Django you are using, or perhaps some of the third party libraries you are using. \\n\\n3. Finally, I am working on launching a podcast featuring makers who submitted a project on buildwithdajngo.com. Would you be willing to be one of the first guests? \\n\\n    This would be a short 30-minute interview asking you about your experience with Django. Discussing your project and your career. \\n    \\n    Unfortunately, I can\\'t promise that you will have a huge spike of users going to your website since I don\\'t have a big following. But we would certainly need to start somewhere. \\n    \\n    The point is that in the current situation, it would be you giving me a favor as well as just getting to know each other and having some fun on the phone. \\n    \\n    For me personally, I would love to get to know your story a little more. It would be an honor.\\n    \\nThanks a ton in advance. If you are not comfortable with some or all of the questions above, I totally understand. No, hard feelings. \\n\\nAgain, thanks for submitting your project!\\n\\nBest,\\nRasul',\n",

       "  'body': 'I just finished writing the \"2019 in Review\" post where I went over the things that I made happen in 2019. It felt great, I recommend everyone do it. \\n\\nWhile writing the post I kept thinking  \"ok, I need to do this in 2020\". I think it is a good ideas to write down some goals for 2020. Not to always look at them to make sure you accomplish them. Rather, to give you some point of comparison in the end of next year. When I\\'m writing 2020 in Review I will be able to see what was important to me in the end of 2019 and what changed during the next year. \\n\\nSo, without further ado here are a few small goals I have for 2020.\\n\\n## TL;DR\\n\\n1. Build two web apps\\n2. Become a better Data Analyst\\n3. Learn and become way more proficient with Web Technology\\n4. Become the master of my mind and life\\n5. Earn some from a side hustle\\n6. Become more sociable\\n7. Become a more loving husband\\n8. Write more often\\n9. Start a podcast\\n10. Get out of debt \\n11. Buy an existing company\\n12. If 1, 10 and 11 are successful set up an LLC.\\n\\n## 1. Build two web apps\\n\\nI think financial success lies in both quantity and quality. When it comes to building SaaS product one doesn\\'t come without the other. If you look at prolific makes like Josh Pigford, Porter Levels, Mubashar Iqbal, Tyler Tringas, Justin Jackson and others, you will see that they have been building for years and that is a huge reason for their current success.\\n\\nI understand that success doesn\\'t come without Grit, i.e. working and trying without giving up. No matter what I want to keep building and learning to build better products. Two SaaS projects seems like a doable goal. \\n\\n## 2. Become a better Data Analyst\\n\\nI thought becoming a data science is my dream for a long time, now that I have worked with new department within Guy Carpenter I understand I am very far from that. Instead I want to improve a lot in my position of Data Analyst.\\nTo be more specific, I want to get more accustomed working with large datasets, via Spark. My goal is not receive a tons of error everytime I try to do anything, and not Google eversidedoesn idea I have. I need to drastically improve my speed and efficiency.\\n\\nI want to also become a much better Data storyteller. This is a vital skill not only in professional setting, but very useful in life and personal projects.\\n\\n## 3. Learn and become way more proficient with Web Technologies\\n\\nLearn to Stripe. This would mean to learn to integrate Stripe API and Stripe.js into my current and future Django projects. Currently I just can\\'t figure that out. This doesn\\'t mean I have to become an expert in each, APIs and JavaScript, but dealing with Stripe flow will certainly greatly improved my understanding in both. \\n\\nActually, I have a list of things I\\'d like to learn and write posts about. There a bunch of them actually. Here is a small sample: \\n* D3.js\\n* Webmentions \\n* GraphQl\\n* Vue.js (Gridsome, JavaScript)\\n* LaTeX\\n* ArcGIS,PostGIS and GEO in general\\n* Serverless Computing\\n\\nNext on the list are webmentions and D3.js. I am going to experiment with both through my personal Website. Should be an interesting and rewarding process. \\n\\n## 4. Become the master of my mind and life\\n\\nThis is a broad goal as well. It includes, meditation, diet, emotion controlling and spending habits.\\nIn an attempt to make this more accountable I would like to make a goal of:\\n* Do morning exercise, meditation and journaling on 70% of mornings in 2020.\\n* 70% of my weekdays must be sweetless.\\n\\nI think achieving this will make a huge difference in my life.\\n\\n## 5. Earn some from a side hustle\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter if it just $1 dollar. It is important to start. It could be through some consulting, or from a photoshoot, or from one of my web apps. As long as it makes some money.\\n\\n## 6. Become more sociable\\n\\nMeet 50 new people. Meeting fellow Indiehackers is the first thing that comes to mind. However there is a plethora of other people to meet. Django developers, Data Analysts and Scientists. \\n\\nWith Tanya we could meet people at board game meetups or photographers meetups perhaps.\\n\\nConnections and relationships are everything.\\n\\n## 7. Become a more loving husband\\n\\nShow my love to my wife more often. Show her signs of affection and gratitude. Surprise her more often. \\n\\nCertainly try to argue less and and do less shouting. \\n\\n## 8. Write more often\\n\\nShare my learnings, my explorations and anything else that could be useful to people. Make at least 50 blog posts in 2020.\\n\\n## 9. Start a podcast\\n\\nStart a podcast for Built with Django.\\n\\n\\n## 10. Get out of Debt\\n\\nOne of the biggest causes of my stress in 2019 is due to unhealthy finances. We are spending way more than I earn. And I fucking myself for that. That lack of discipline and control very upsetting. So this is a big goal for 2020. \\n\\nReducing costs to reflect my income. More importantly pay out all of my debts and loans. Get to zero money owned by April. This is by far one of the most important goals for 2020. The only reason it is not #1 is because I somehow thought about it right before posting.\\n\\n## 11. Buy an existing company\\n\\nUsing learning from Ryan Kulp\\'s microacqusitions class buy an existing business. Start growing it.\\n\\n## 12. If 1, 10 and 11 are successful set up an LLC\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI have been thinking about those for a while now, and am pretty sure this is a good and exhaustive list. I am \\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': 'I have seen a few \"2019 Year in Review\" posts on Twitter and that it would be cool to write one too.\\n\\nWhere should I start? This is the question I\\'m thinking about, right now. I think that\\'s a good sign. Without going in deep into my thoughts I can see that there are at least a few things I can talk about. \\n\\nI am now excited to write this post, just to remind myself that I have been doing good and can expect a lot more from 2020. \\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n* It was stressful.\\n* I learned a ton of web related technologies.\\n* Wow... So much happened, it is crazy.\\n* This year was about discovering various communities and opening myself to those and to the world in general.\\n* There are a ton of cool and exciting things in the world. We have a whole life to discover them. In fact, there are too many, and making sure to only focus on the best and most important is crucial. Only do and learn things that make you say Hell yes.\\n\\n\\n## Early 2019\\n\\nThe beginning of 2019 started of with me and my wife celebrating New Year\\'s in our little room in 5BR in Cambridge Massachusetts. It was scary, because I just graduated, without any job offers. Our lease was running out in mid January. We generally did not know what is next. At that time I was hoping to receive an internship opportunity with my previous employer. So, it was a little scary and somewhat stressful.\\n\\nThankfully I received that offer. The office is located in NYC, so we started packing up for a move to NY. We spend a month going from one Airbnb to another in search of an apartment where it would be just the two of us. Long story short, we found a great apartment in Newark, NJ. It honestly felt great to stop moving from place to place, moving a lot of our stuff. Sadly, due to the moving, my wife\\'s birthday was a little disappointing to her. Hopefully, this year we can make up for that.\\n\\nThe only disadvantage to all of that is the fact that I didn\\'t get receive my EAD card which would allow me to start my employment. Because of that we had to take a loan to make payments for our new apartment. Still paying out that loan, with hopes to end that nightmare mid 2020. Huge thanks to my father who could support as during that time also.\\n\\n## Starting the hustle\\n\\nWhile not being employed I thought it would be cool to start something that could potentially bring us an alternative income. My salary was not going to cover everything unfortunately, it still does not. \\n\\nI remember clearly, that the only reason I got an idea to do that was thanks to Tim Ferriss. I am forever grateful to this man. I have been reading his \"4 Hour\" series while in my last semester in college. \\n\\nWithout going into too much detail, this is what I have done during the March of 2019. Bought two domains:\\n\\n* osarjournal.com\\n* yourguidestolife.com\\n\\nBought \"BlueHost\" hosting plan. Started working on two of my ideas. A service that will allow students to show their work to the world (Open Source Analytics Journal) and a list of useful guide that you get for paying a subscription fee. Needless to say, both of these failed, but they did give me an important lesson. I didn\\'t like WordPress. More specifically I did not like the fact that I can\\'t customize it very well, and all the useful packages I needed were payed. \\n\\n> Why in the world would I pay for simple forms?!?\\n\\n> Interestingly, I remember stumbling upon \"Make payed subscriptions with Django\" class on Lynda.com, which was perfect at the time. But after going through a few videos I dropped it. It did not stick. It is interesting, because right now Django, is the only one framework that I understand well. \\n\\nMy next venture was Fermentline. I heard a lot of great things about Shopify and wanted to give it a try. For a person who does not earn any money, $79 bucks might seem like a bit much. Nonetheless, I decided to try it. I have recently picked up a passion for fermentation. \\n\\n> I have been making Kombucha at home. I was making fermented garlic, pickles and other foods. I even tried to become a food YouTuber. More in that later.\\n\\nCan\\'t remember why, but I thought that it would be cool to sell fermentation related apparel. No one else was making it (it still seems like a relatively good idea). Long Story short, that failed, with me paying from three months of Shopify. \\n\\nStill, this was a rewarding experience. I got to work with freelance designers. This was my first attempt to build a web page. It is extremely easy with Shopify. \\n\\n> One thing that makes me laugh now is the amount of motivational videos I watched. Motivational is probably the wrong word there. A better description is \"How to earn a shit load of many dropshipping on Shopify\" kind of videos. \\n\\nI stopped this project around the time I received my EAD card and started my internship, ones again. \\n\\n\\n## Learning Web Dev\\n\\nMid March I started working for Guy Carpenter. At first I was extremely excited. Finally, a real job. I was extremely excited about the commute even. I read on my beloved kindle while I was on NJ Transit, then listening to podcasts while walking to work. The same deal on the way back to home. \\n\\nThe podcast I was listening mostly was \"The Tim Ferriss podcast\". I have only recently discovered it and God there was a lot of things I had to catch up. So many great interviews. Interviews with Jason Fried, Derek Sivers and Naval Ravikant are one of my favorites. The one podcast that changed a lot for me was featuring Ramit Sethi. To be honest, I don\\'t remember exactly what it was, but in general the accessiblness of gathering wealth. One of the key things I remember was sin writing guest posts.\\n\\nWhile I was doing a Google research I have stumbled upon a couple of personal websites. One that comes to mind is Tom Critchlow website. I thought, \"wow, that was cool, I need to make a personal Website and start doing consulting work to increase my revenue.\" Tom\\'s website was done with Jekyll. I started googling and ended up choosing to make website with Jekyll and host it on GitHub Pages... That was a slow process. I remember I was actually writing code in GitHub, commiting changes and waiting for the website to change. I remember trying to a \"resume\" format website. After thinking I was done, I tried opening on my phone and... it was shit🤣. I remember using tachyons for my CSS, without actually not knowing how CSS works properly (again, thanks to Tim for inspiration).\\n\\nI don\\'t want to go into too much detail. This is not an autobiography, although, there is certainly a lot of things I would love to put on paper. This is how my journey to web development started. \\n\\nActually, funny I should mention autobiography. Around the same time I read The Bullet Journal book. I have been trying to journal, on and off, but this book helped me make it more stable habit. I\\'m still working on doing regular entries, but it was an amazing start, and I can\\'t recommend it more. The BuJo method actually inspired me to build a project I\\'m working on right now - Kushim.\\n\\n## Networking\\n\\nAround the same time I decided to make an effort to meet more people, a.k.a Networking. I do mean professional networking. I struggled getting a single interview while on my last semester at Northeastern. I started contacting people on LinkedIn, asking for advice. I focused on people who work in Data Science sphere, as it is what I was very interested in. Surprisingly, people are nicer in real life. I got a lot of responses and a lot of meetings.\\n\\nI am thankful for this act of courage from my side. I have wasted my college years on watching TV shows and other things like that, not meeting people, not trying new things. \\n\\nI have recently started to prefer stey at work and code my own projects rather than meet new people during lunch. I think this is something I need to return in my schedule. Connections are everything.\\n\\n## Career Switch \\n\\nI started of my employment as an Actuarial intern. I\\'ve tried to pass the Actuarial exams several times, but failed miserably each time, which is why I decided to meet more people, to find a new job in 6 months,while I was there. I failed in that too. Can you fucking imagine? In six months of job applications and networking, I did not get a single fucking on-site interview. Not one!\\n\\nThankfully, my boss at the time offered to extend my internship. So I had another six months to network and apply for jobs. At the same time my boss asked me whether I want to keep trying to pass exams. While it was scary to say no, as there was a chance I might get fired, not extended. I am grateful that he didn\\'t take it personally and offered to help find a new position within company. I\\'m so grateful for that.\\n\\n## Starting to Data Science\\n\\nI found an interesting position within GC at a Data Strategy Department. I contacted the hiring manager, Alan Anders and we talked a little on the phone, despite the fact that his calendar had not one single spot. I\\'m thankful he took time to speak with me and tell me about the position. I got so excited. The journey of transition started.\\n\\nI\\'m now helping him with various data related tasks. Or rather trying to help. Even though I was interest in Data Analysis for a while now, there were so many new things that I got quickly overwhelmed. Receiving so many error and being able to advance during the day is very discouraging. I really like working with Alan. Even if I only work part time.\\n\\n## Indiehackers\\n\\nIndiehackers is an amazing community of people who want to start their own business without venture capital, bootstrapped. Mostly that would mean people who can code and want to build something like a web app. \\n\\nI can\\'t remember how I found that community, I tried really hard but just can\\'t remember. To be honest though, it doesn\\'t matter. What matters is that I did find it. At the time I found Indiehackers, I just started to building my own website and did not know how to do \"professional\" coding.\\n\\nI got extremely excited about building a web app, a SaaS business to support myself and my family. So I have added another goal to my list - learning a to build web apps. \\n\\n## Web Development / SaaS\\n\\nI started researching on what I would need to build a web app and the list was just to overwhelming... Php, Node.js, JavaScript, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Django. That was a lot. Since I didn\\'t know anything, I had to pick, that pick would probably be very important, sir I would have to stock to it for some time. Just because I learned Python before (for Data Analysis purposes) I decided to teach myself Django. \\n\\nFirst, I decided to rebuild my website. That was a long process. William Vincent tutorials were a huge help. Huge! Thanks William.\\n\\nAgain, I don\\'t want to go into to much details, but the rebuild was somewhat successful. I now had a blog, a now page and \"What I learnt this week\" page. Since my website was hosted on Digital Ocean Ubuntu droplet, I got to learn Nginx, Gunicorn, and using command line. Knowing that a lot of things are possible with Django, I started recording my ideas for possible future projects. The list now is now long. I am excited to try those in the future when I am very good at Django 😁.\\n\\nNow, I am building Kushim. It is my attempt to build a life management system for myself. Main features are Journaling, Digital Garden and Network database to help you manage your relationships. I am almost done building a solid V1. The only things left to do is to set up a billing process for pro accounts. And to set up automated emails for network app. I really hope to finish those soon and move onto the next project.\\n\\n## Open Source Community\\n\\nLearning to code involved using GitHub a lot. On GitHub people share their code. This encourages sharing and helping. Open source community is all about sharing helping and doing things together. \\n\\nDerek Sivers was the main reason discovered Open Source (OS) community. In one of his posts (about database building) he suggested people use MonicaHQ. Monica is an OS project. Although you can pay for it, I decided to attempt to install it on my own server. That was challenging. Very challenging. This is the first time I\\'ve run into that many errors. \\n\\n> This is actually happening to me at work right now. Errors. Errors everywhere.\\n\\nThe only reason I pushed through that is pure excitement and enthusiasm. I really wanted for it to work. A website only I can access which hosts all my contacts and reminds me to contact them. This project was built with php, which wasn\\'t my favourite thing to deal with. Thankfully, I had a lot of time in the evenings at that point and finally made it work. \\n\\nAt that point I was obsessed with OS projects. Not very proud, but I started to get a little griddy. I was thinking \"what else can I use for free\". Then the novelty wore off, I got better at removing things I didn\\'t need, I changed. Now, I thought \"what projects can I help\". Since I knew a little Python and Django, I couldn\\'t contribute to many projects.\\n\\nI started contributing to some instructions and other less important things. Even took part on Hacktoberfest winning a t shirt for contributing to 5 projects. Very proud of that.\\n\\n\\n## Family\\n\\nIn the summer, my wife went back home to Russia for a month. I remember that saying good bye was very very hard! We promised never to do that again. So when we get in a fight, or argue, I try to remember that moment. Helps me remind myself how much I care about her and love her. \\n\\nSometimes it is indeed hard, very hard. But going through all the hard things together is important. Knowing that there is always someone by your side is very comforting and helpful. \\n\\nGenerally we have had a lot of ups and downs. We are a young couple, a young family. We have a whole life ahead of us to learn about each other and make a great family. I am thankful for all the good and bad moments to my wife. Each one second I spend with her is a great second.\\n\\n\\n## Stoicism\\n\\nDiscovering Stoicism, was a big help. I feel that attempting to practice Stoicism makes me a better human being. Makes be better at appreciating what I have, makes me better I controlling my emotions. Sometimes they get out of control. I get too angry very quickly, offloading it onto my wife, which is unacceptable. \\n\\nPlease note, I said \"attempting to practice\". Becoming a stoic is hard, and I will spend the rest of my life improving myself. But I think the hardest think of discovering and choosing a philosophy of life is done. Now to applications.\\n\\nAlong with Stoicism I try to exercise and meditate every morning. I try to do this to also keep my brain under control for many things. Keeping emotions under control, being disciplined on my professional life, not allowing myself to distract easily. \\n\\n## Overall\\n\\nI am very happy I decided and took the time to write this post. I realized that a lot was accomplished in the last year, or even last half a year. This makes me very excited about 2020. A lot of things to do, a lot to learn. \\n\\nI\\'m forever grateful for everything life throws at me. Especially because most of what it throws is good. Greatful for all the people who i get to interact everyday. Grateful for all the new people i met. \\n\\nLooking back on this year, I know that our future is bright. It is important to never forget that. \\n\\nI know that not many people will read this and that is fine. But if you somehow read the whole thing or at least scrolled all the way here, know this: \\n\\nYou can make anything happen. You just need to start doing things, one step at a time. Don\\'t try to make everything happen at once, that won\\'t happen. But if you do a little everyday, it is inane what you can achieve in a year.\\n\\nThanks to 2019 for everything happened in 2019. Good luck to everyone in 2020.\\n\\n✌️\\n\\n',\n",

You have built a great and in many ways unique company. I currently don\\'t have a need or means of getting any of your products, unfortunately. Once, I reach my dream of building a company that will help me sustain a semi-nomadic lifestyle I know for a fact I will be choosing one of your products.\\n\\nI want to thank you for the content you put out there. I find it inspiring, motivational and most importantly useful. My favorites are \"How to Get an Interview\" and \"Remote Companies Hire for Impact, Not for Potential\", naturally. I am now in the process of job hunting.\\n\\nThis email is purely to thank you for your work, both as a Founder and Writer. So, I apologise for this shameless plug. \\n\\nI\\'m a data analyst with experience in machine learning and web development (https://kushim.io). If you ever need any help with analytics I would gladly help. The immediate impact I would provide is going through all the existing data to find patterns that crucial for business decision making. I prefer to make dashboards to allow the end user view it nicely in the browser and explore some data for himself. I would then be able to take the existing data and predict future patterns that would allow for strategic decision making. \\n\\nIf it doesn\\'t trouble you too much could I ask for you opinion on this plug? \\n\\nAgain, the main purpose for this letter is to thank you for your work and your openness. Thank you! Continue the good work.\\n\\nBest,\\nRasul Kireev\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'body': \"natalie@wildbit.com\\n\\nNatalie,\\n\\nI have been reading a lot of literature aroun launching Saas products and software development. You and you wonderfull company has been talked about in a lot of such place. I can't believe it took me that long to stumble upon an Indiehackers podcast episodes where you spoke about Wildbit. I wanted to say a huge thanks for sharing you experience, story and advice to aspiring indiehackers.\\n\\nI am also writing to you to ask a question. I understand you are extremely busy, so try to keep it short and sweet.\\n\\nI'm a learning a lot about software and web development (with Django to be more specific), but my initial focus and main domain of knowledge and experience lies in Data Analytics / Science. How does Wildbit look at Analytics and possible uses of such skill in service/product development? For instance, do you have a dedicated employee, or perhaps a team that works on developing analytics dashboards both for external and internal use? \\n\\nThanks a ton for takjng the time to read. Again, I wanted to say a huge thanks for your work. I hope there are more companies/teams like your and more people like you who run and create such teams (I hope to contribute too).\\n\\nBest\\nRasul Kireev\",\n",

       "  'body': '# Networking\\n\\n## My Story\\n\\nI am from Russia and from my childhood I knew (so did everyone else), that a majority of jobs are given to people who know other people. It is not uncommon to find different family members and childhood friends working in the same firm, in the same division. That\\'s basically how our government is ran. You don\\'t need to dig deep to see that a lot of government officials and leaders of huge government owned organizations (e.g GazProm) are related to the current president, usually childhood friends (even a judo sparring partner from when the president was much, much younger). That\\'s it, I thought that it is only the case in Russia and other USSR countries. When I arrived to study in the USA I thought I am free of that. Apparently, it wasn\\'t the case. About 4-5 months before my graduation I Started to look for jobs, the good old regular online application style. First applying to awesome companies, awesome jobs, the ones I was excited the most about. Nothing... Then I lowered a bar to good companies and good jobs. Couple of phone calls, that\\'s it, no actual interview.\\n\\n## Short List\\n\\nThe actual process is very simple:\\n\\n1. Identify companies you might want to work for.\\n2. Find an employee/s related to you desired job in that company (on LinkedIn) and send them an invite with a note.\\n3. Repeat this step for all the people you have found and wait until the reply. This is the numbers game, the more you invite the more will accept and reply. Note: Only send an invite to a credible (believable) people.\\n4. Invite people you have connected with for a coffee or a phone call depending on your and their location.\\n5. Prepare for the meeting.\\n6. Attend the meeting.\\n7. Thank them. Keep in contact via email, once every 2-3 weeks.\\n\\nThis is it! I mean there are some further details and suggestions, but this is the essence. You are starting to build a \"network\". In other words, you get to know cool people and let them know you.\\n\\n## Long List\\n\\n### Identifying Companies\\n\\nThis is a very creative process that mostly requires knowledge of Google search. I feel like you have it, since you found this guide! So let\\'s go. Note: if you want to learn some additional google search skills, head over to this guide.\\n\\nYour first Google search item should be this: \"**DESIRED POSITION** **DESIRED LOCATION** great companies\". This is it. You will get a whole page of possible results. This will help you to get the starting list of companies you might want to work at and companies whose employees you can try reaching. Once you scanned the search result for good posts and information lists, visit the company web page and find their \"Careers\" page by pressing \"CTRL F\" (\"CMD F\" for mac) and type in \"Jobs\" or \"Careers\" (if nothing popups, then open a new Google page and type company\\'s name and the word \"Careers\") and got to that page. See if there is a position you like. If there is a position you like then certainly add this company to your list. If there is no position, but you still like the company, then also add it to your list as sometimes not all available positions are listed. If you are very enthusiastic about your job search and see yourself adding a ton of companies to your list, then I suggest you stop at 20 for one day, otherwise you might burn out. If you have completed the next steps for all 20 companies, you can start the process for more companies. If you are not overly enthusiastic about that job search or don\\'t seem to have the time, start at around 5 a day, that should be enough. Even if you can\\'t do 5, do at least 1! Progress is important! Even a small step can take you far in the long term (honestly I found that to be one of the main principles in life).\\n\\n### Finding People\\n\\nLinkedIn is a great resource for finding professionals in your field. What makes it great is the fact that it is the largest social network for professionals and kind of a requirement for anyone who works. This means there is an extremely high probability of finding a knowledgeable person in your chosen field in your current living area! If you have been using LinkedIn search option for a while you will likely see this message.\\n\\n{INSERT IMAGE HERE}\\n\\nDo not worry, not only will I show you how to bypass that, but actually the method I use is good for both limited and unlimited searches, since we want to target specific people.\\n\\nFor this part let\\'s assume you are looking for a Data Science job.\\n\\nOn the main page search for \"data\" or \"data science\" if you want to be more specific. Select People, so that only people show up (not companies or jobs). Choose a company you want to search for (you should have a list of companies you want to target ready). Finally choose the region you currently reside in (as my mentioned earlier this is the best case scenario, since face to face interaction is best). ￼\\n\\nOnce you have your search result go to each person\\'s page (open in new tab) and quickly scan to see if they fit you search parameters. If all is good it is time to send a \"Connect\" request with a note attached. The connect button will either be right under their name and will look like this: ￼ If the \"Connect button does not appear under their name it will be in the \"More...\" section. Press that and you will see the \"Connect\" button. Once you do that you will see the following message: ￼ Press \"Add a note\". You will see this window next: ￼Type in you message (or use the template I provide in Appendix A). Please note that you message must be shorter than 300 characters. Once you are done, send an invitation and simply wait. You want to do this for each person you found. Now all you have to do is wait until you hear back from people you wanted to connect with. If you apply to multiple people, the waiting time shouldn\\'t be more than a couple of days.\\n\\nThis is basically it for finding people. It is as easy as that. Once you get comfortable with this search algorithm, I suggest you try searching for specific skills, which might lead you to people with desired skill set, but a different job, in which case you might be lucky to find a new path for yourself. In any case, LinkedIn has million users and you can find each and one of them using this search option. I hope you realise that one of those people could show or help you to reach your goals. This is huge and one would be very silly not to use that. This is a big step towards your goals. The only bigger step is to contact those people and actually meet with them. Let\\'s see how we do that.\\n\\n### Coffee invitation\\n\\nLet me start by saying that this can and will be intimidating at first. It is very natural and human like to be afraid of connecting with other people, especially if you are an introvert. I think that this fear of connecting is coming from the fear of failing. Deep down inside you might be feeling like if you fail this one interaction, you will be done for life. I know, this is a little extreme, but it makes it easier to convey my point. To this I want to say: \"Do not worry! Everything is going to be alright\". First of all not only do you get to meet a ton of people, which means one bad meeting won\\'t do any bad for your \"reputation\". More than that it will give you experience into the art of conversation and will make it less likely to be a failure in the future. Making mistakes can sometimes be good. Additionally, you might be surprised how nice can people be and usually are! So, there is nothing to be scared about. Once people start to connect with you, you can begin the \"invitation to coffee\" process. When I say invite for coffee I mean any kind of meeting or interaction, but I call it \"Invite for coffee\" because it is the preferred method of connecting. Nothing beats a face-to-face interaction. You should not opt in for the other type of connection because of fear or anything like that. You should only resort for other types of connection (phone call, LinkedIn question) only if you have a geographical barrier (you are in a different city or a different country), or just can not meet with a person. If the person on the other side of conversation agrees to meet, great! If he does not, he or she will tell you. In that case it would be ok to start with a LinkedIn question and work your way up to a face-to-face meeting. (You can use the templates from Appendix A to contact your connections). Keep in mind that people you want to connect with are probably professional and have a very tight schedule, so you should mention how much time your potential meeting will take. Don\\'t say 10 minutes, because this is obviously not true. Stick with 30 minutes, or 27 if you want to stand out (but make sure you actually stick with this time). Remember that the person you are trying to meet with is giving you a favor (if he accepts of course), so try to make it as easy as possible. Look where they work exactly and offer a place to meet in their neighborhood. You don\\'t want to overload them with questions about time and location, but just let them know that any time and any place will be fine. Depending on you own time schedule you might or might not have time. Nevertheless, try to squeeze in some availability for this event. If you are a college student, great! You will certainly have time. Whatever you have scheduled for the time you invitee wants to meet can be rescheduled. There is nothing more important than your future and this is the best use of your time regarding your future career, besides you will enjoy it! Trust me! If you are currently employed, try to aim for time before work, during lunch or after work. The person you are contacting is probably employed (it is why you are contacting them after all), so they will probably want to aim for lunch time also. Whatever you do, be mindful of another person\\'s time.\\n\\n### Meeting Preparation\\n\\nIt is crucial to come prepared to this type of meeting. There is nothing hard about this preparation, but the payoff is huge. This will show your invitee that you are serious about your request and more importantly a structured well thought person. If not for that reason, then it is just good to be prepared and not waste time on weather questions. As per usual you can find some templates in Appendix A. So, here is what you want to do: 1) Open up a Google Doc (or MS Word, whatever you use) and you also want to open the LinkedIn page of the person you are going to meet. 2) Look for the most interesting experiences the person had (e.g. created a startup, sold a painting for $10K) or the job description you personally you\\'d like to do some day. 3) Make those things a heading in you Doc and write down a couple of questions under that heading. Questions can include \"How did you get here? (Short story)\", \"What is the best advice to get there?\", \"Do you enjoy it?\". Note: Ask questions that will be useful to you, and at the same time give an opportunity to the other person to talk about themselves. People love to talk about themselves. This should generate quite a few questions! If it didn\\'t, look some more. You should focus on what you need (find a job, find a life calling or advice in learning a new skill), but through context of people\\'s lives. 4) On their LinkedIn page they might have some external links to Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, or even their personal website. Visit those and note something that interests you and make up a question about it. 5) Print out your doc and bring it to the meeting. (Try to keep the doc to one page).\\n\\n### Meeting time\\n\\nWhatever location you and your invitee picked, try to arrive 5 minutes early. That way you can find a place to sit and talk. One big issue I had with my \"meetings\" is who pays for the coffee. What you want to do while on your way to the meet up, is to message (email or LinkedIn) the person you are meeting to ask what they would prefer to drink. If they answer by the drink once you arrive at the previously agreed location. If they don\\'t reply by the time you and they get there (which surprisingly happens 95% of the time) offer to buy them a drink at the spot. If they agree, good, buy the drink, but they don\\'t agree, offer once more, saying this is a way to say thank you. If after the second try they still don\\'t accept the drink than don\\'t argue and do what they say. I don\\'t want it to sound like a script, but just a way to be a good person. Attend the meeting with the intent to pay for drinks (or whatever you are getting), since the person meeting you is giving you a favour and losses some of its precious time. But. People are generally very nice and kind, which is why the majority of people I have connected with on LinkedIn paid for me. I always didn\\'t like it, since it made me a little uncomfortable, but one of my connections said a thing I will always remember. \"Right now I\\'m getting coffee for you, but in a few years when people ask you to meet them for a coffee, you\\'ll them a cup.\" In words of Elton John, \"It\\'s a circle of life\".\\n\\nNow that we have dealt with the topic of who pays for what, let\\'s move on. While talking to the person try to stay on topics you prepared, but don\\'t be too attached. There is a fine line between wasting time on unnecessary topics and discovering something new you didn\\'t think of. This is something you will develop with more experience, but the rule of thumb is not to get of another tangent for more than 4-5 minutes. It is better to discuss questions you have prepared, since you know they will bring value to you.\\n\\nIf during the conversation your invitee asks you a question, make sure you answer it, don\\'t ignore it to move on to your questions, afterall they might be interested in you as well, otherwise they wouldn\\'t have met with you.\\n\\nAsk if your invitee wouldn\\'t mind you taking notes during the meeting, because some people don\\'t like to see the other person writing while he is speaking (might seem like you are not listening). Besides, you probably won\\'t need to make too many notes, most of the things you will discuss are high level.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to sound cheesy, but most importantly enjoy the conversion. Psychology and body language are a big part of networking (we don\\'t need to get down into more details, it\\'s really simple). When the person sitting in front of you sees that you are smiling, participating and actually learning, they will too enjoy the conversation! This will yield a much better conversation and a much better connection! Good for you, good for your invitee.\\n\\nAnother extremely important about the meeting is that you should not be asking for employment or other big benefits straight away (or at all for that matter). Instead, start with questions that will entail the other person to tell a story, not a simple yes/no question. If you ask for referral straight away they will most likely think you are not at all interested in them, but rather in something else. Remember, we are doing this for the long-term relationships. The long-term relationship approach will help you both get a referral and a contact of a highly skilled professional you could consult with in the future. Actually, if you are patient, you don\\'t even have to wait that long. Couple of people I have met with offered it during the first meet up and I didn\\'t even have to bring it up. Just make sure you don\\'t go to the meeting with the intent to use the invitee as a referral. Use the meeting to learn! It\\'s very likely that the person your are having a meeting with will offer to refer you themselves. If they don\\'t you will ask them later in the email (or LinkedIn message).\\n\\nOne thing I suggest you mention during the meeting is your background (they will probably ask anyway). Additionally mention that it might be harder to get a job as an international, which is why you\\'re reaching out to professionals and asking for their advice. This will help you know what to focus on, what to learn and generally your path towards your desired career. This will give you a competitive advantage over your peers.\\n\\n### Keep in touch\\n\\nYou\\'ve done all the hard work. Congratulations, you are now much closer to getting that job!\\n\\nFirst of all, make sure you thank your new contact for meeting with you, preferably within 2 days. When thanking them please be more or less specific. More specifically, make a little note of something that you talked about during the meeting, this will show that you actually listed and retained most of the information, thus increasing the chances of them referring you to a position within the firm.\\n\\nOnce you thanked them, let them be for a few days (up to a week). Meanwhile, heavily research the position you would like to apply for within the company of your contact. See what are the requirements for the candidates, make sure you fit into some of those, at least. Prepare all the documents that are required to apply. Once you are ready, submit all the documentation. When you have submitted your application, it is time to message your contact within your firm. (Please see the message template in the Appendix A.)\\n\\nThe message will have to state that you have applied to a certain position within their company (the fact that you have already applied shows your eagerness). Additionally you will ask if it is possible for them to send over your information to their recruiting staff (Human Resources), making sure that you attach all necessary documents to your message (you want to make it as easy as possible for them to refer you). There are two things that can happen here. You get referred. Great. This raises your odds to get an interview. This is entirely a different step you need to prepare for differently. We will talk about interview prep in a different section. For an international student getting past the screening process is a huge step, so congratulations! The second case is that your contact didn\\'t reply, or said that they won\\'t refer you. Don\\'t get angry or mad, they have their own reasons, that\\'s fine! You might or might not get the interview, no need to stress about it. What you need to do is to move on to another contact you found on LinkedIn and repeat the process. Remember, the strength is in numbers.\\n\\nYou are now done with the application to that specific company, congrats. Whatever the outcome of your ask for referral was, it is important to keep in touch. Hopefully you have written down or remembered (better to write down) something specific about your contact. So, if you see something that reminds you of the contact, an article, a book or if you have a question you\\'d like to ask (only specific questions), do ask, people like to help. Don\\'t message them more than once a week. Once or twice a month is more than enough.\\n\\nYou will be surprised how much good come out of this habit to meet new people, more specifically professionals within your desired field. What will surprise you even more is how much you will start enjoying this! Trust me on this one. I was a full on introvert (and still am), and didn\\'t like to talk much to people I didn\\'t now. Now, I really enjoy this process and try finding new people to talk to about my desired career.\\n',\n",

Generally though, we will cover all the required components of a successful job search. So, don\\'t be afraid and follow along.\\n\\n## Convention\\n\\nCurrently, there is a clear path drawn by the society. You graduate you search for a job on Indeed.com or some similar website, apply, interview and get a job. That does sound good and easy, but the reality is slightly different. It has become much harder to find good jobs for recent graduates using this \"tried and true\" method. It is important to note that I am talking about US students. For an international student in the US it is even harder to find a good job, if he is lucky to find one at all.\\n\\n## Struggle\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you are passionate about Data Science (very popular and dense career path right now) and are looking for an entry-level position. You will soon find (or already know) that there are a ton of candidates out there and sending you resume online won\\'t do you any good. More than that, there is a high chance that after pressing a \"Will require sponsorship\" button, your resume is sent to a \"don\\'t look at this pile\" pile. \"Wow. That\\'s getting depressing\" you might think, but don\\'t worry, there is a way to differ from other candidates (in a good way). In this guide I will go through the steps necessary to put yourself in front of other candidates and increase your chances of getting a job.\\n\\n## Promises\\n\\nWhat I can promise with this guide is that you will raise your odds of finding a good and well paid job at least 2x. By following the steps provided here you will be in the top 10% candidates of international students in your desired field. What I can\\'t promise, unfortunately is that by finishing this guide you will automatically be employed, that is just not realistic.

       "  'body': '# Branding\\n\\n## Resume\\n\\nResume can be very important. Resume is the industry standard for displaying your skills and experiences in the format of one page, which in my opinion is ridiculous, but then again, no one asked for my opinion. Actually (I\\'m sorry to ramble like that), you did, and my honest opinion is that it is ridiculous, but it doesn\\'t mean we are not going to squeeze every last drop of usefulness from this silly standard. We are going to build a simple, to-the-point resume that will convey the person your, whatever that might be, we will remove all the waste, which is going to separate you from the crowd (most resumes are just a compilation of lies and fairy tales of people lying to themselves).\\n\\nNote: Do not worry about missing something out, we will make a personal website that doesn\\'t have to be one page long and you can put whatever you want there (hopefully no lies though). We will do this soon, and it\\'s going to be very simple, don\\'t worry.\\n\\nSo, as always I will leave a couple of templates you should follow in the Appendix (I recommend the first one). In this section I will just give you the main guidelines for your resume and if you follow most or all of them you will be in good shape.\\n\\n## Blogging\\n\\nThe blogging has been on the rise recently and there are many good reasons for that. Just to give you some perspective, you are probably read some kind of blog (or a set of blogs) regularly. As I said, there are many reasons why blogging is a good practice, we are not going to get into all of them, that would take ages. The main reason we are considering blogging is to show what you know. Before you get scared and abandon this idea and skip this part of the chapter, let me assure you, it is so easy, it would be hard to believe. I bet you think of a super high quality blog with tons of text and tons of readers and think to yourself that there is no reason to start your own, \"why would people look at me, when there is something like that\". Well, first of all you should not be looking at other and compare them to yourself (that\\'s like the first rule of life), because fame is not our goal right now. Our goal is to show our potential employer that we have thought and that we are capable of presenting them in a written format, which is a HUGE part of any job. Showing your communication skills is crucial! A lot of people might argue with that, but I personally believe it is better to write something (even if it has a couple of errors), rather than not writing at all. (We are going to go through a couple of steps to prevent any kind of errors on your blog).\\n\\n## Online Presence\\n\\nAnother important thing you can do for your career is to show your proficiency and your proaction. One awesome way to do that is too help people online with questions they have about your preferred topic. More than that, by asking question on those forums you\\'ll show that you are not afraid of admitting your mistakes and your desire to learn. Plus, plus, plus. Note: you never know who you might help, it could be a potential employer of yours.\\n\\nSo here are the places I recommend you register and start being active. Just check it out once a week (make an event on you calendar) for an hour or two. This will go a long way. The earlier you begin the more benefits you can reap.\\n\\n### Stack Exchange\\n\\nHead over to <https://stackexchange.com/> and click on \"speech bubble\" icon in the top right corner. ￼ Skim through all the groups and see if there is one related to your topic/desired career. If there is one, register.\\n',\n",

       "  'title': 'Influence by Robert B. Cialdini',\n",
       "  'body': '**1. Weapons of Influence**\\n\\n- In today’s world, we need the **first advantage to handle pocketbook strain**; but we need **the second advantage to handle** something potentially more important - **brain strain. (?)**\\n- Automatic behavior patterns make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who does know how they work\\n- There are several components shared by most of the weapons of automatic influence to be described in this book:\\n\\n1. The nearly mechanical process by which the power within these weapons can be activated\\n\\n2. The consequent exploitability of this power by anyone who knows how to trigger them\\n\\n3. The way that the weapons of automatic influence lend their force to those who use them\\n\\n- In the end of this chapter\\xa0author give a few examples on **human perception**. The idea where people judge things differently after being in contact with the same thing but worse or better.\\n\\n**2. Reciprocation: *The Old Give and Take … and Take***\\n\\n- ***\\xa0 \\xa0*** Idea that people have that sense of\\xa0(reciprocation) which tells them, in simplest terms, if someone gives them something, they have to give something in return, whatever the size of this return.\\n- Another idea\\xa0is where use both human\\xa0perception and reciprocation, as in the example of the boy who sold me a chocolate.\\n- People tend to return a favor, thus the pervasiveness of\\xa0[free samples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_sample)\\xa0in marketing. In his conferences, he often uses the example of\\xa0[Ethiopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia)\\xa0providing thousands of dollars in humanitarian aid to\\xa0[Mexico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico)\\xa0just after the 1985 earthquake, despite Ethiopia suffering from a crippling famine and civil war at the time. Ethiopia had been reciprocating for the diplomatic support Mexico provided when Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. The\\xa0[good cop/bad cop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_cop/bad_cop)strategy is also based on this principle. - ***Wikipedia***\\n\\n*3.*  **Commitment and Consistency:**  *Hobgoblins of the Mind*\\n\\n- In the simplest form and idea that when a human states their opinion prior to the question or an act that was act to do it is highly \"possible\" that this person will stick to his earlier stated opinion. Examples, with Chinese prisoners, Toy companies, Sherman strategy and the great companies trick, where they ask consumers to right an essay about why they love their product, that makes consumer buy/love more of it, all apply very well.\\n- If people commit, orally or in writing, to an idea or goal, they are more likely to honor that commitment because of establishing that idea or goal as being congruent with their self-image. Even if the original incentive or motivation is removed after they have already agreed, they will continue to honor the agreement. Cialdini notes Chinese brainwashing on American\\xa0[prisoners of war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war)\\xa0to rewrite their self-image and gain automatic unenforced compliance. See\\xa0[cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). - ***Wikipedia***\\n\\n**4. Social Proof: *Truths are us***\\n\\n- A simple idea, that we\\xa0- the human, do things that are socially approved, that everyone else doing.\\n- A story in the end of the chapter\\xa0shows perfectly how can this principle deceive our thinking and make us act\\xa0not entirely rational.\\n- People will do things that they see other people are doing. For example, in one experiment, one or more confederates would look up into the sky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were seeing. At one point this experiment aborted, as so many people were looking up that they stopped traffic. See\\xa0[conformity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformity_(psychology)), and the\\xa0[Asch conformity experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments). - ***Wikipedia***\\n\\n**5. Liking: *The Friendly Thief***\\n\\n- ***\\xa0 \\xa0*** What this\\xa0chapter basically says is that when it comes to our friends or people we like (or just even know) we are more vulnerable. We are much easier to persuade to buy certain things or do something, just like in the example of Tupperware party.\\n- People are easily persuaded by other people that they like. Cialdini cites the marketing of\\xa0[Tupperware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupperware)\\xa0in what might now be called\\xa0[viral marketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_marketing). People were more likely to buy if they liked the person selling it to them. Some of the many biases favoring more attractive people are discussed. See\\xa0[physical attractiveness stereotype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_attractiveness_stereotype). - ***Wikipedia***\\n\\n**6*.* Authority: *The Directed Deference***\\n\\n- In this chapter, Robert Cialdini\\xa0talks about our tendency to obey the people who stand higher then you in the social status, whether it is a police officer, a billionaire or a president. Moreover, we are much more easily persuaded not only by the actual people who are in higher social position, but look like them. So, if you run into a man with a good looking suit, your subconscious mind tells you that this person as important and you better listen to him not get in any trouble (or any other incentive would do).\\n- People will tend to obey authority figures, even if they are asked to perform objectionable acts. Cialdini cites incidents such as the\\xa0[Milgram experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)\\xa0in the early 1960s and the\\xa0[My Lai massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_massacre). - ***Wikipedia***\\n\\n**7. Scarcity: *The Rule of the Few***\\n\\n- ***\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0***Human mind is weird. We tend to pay for things more if we thing they are scarce. This is the reason some people are ready to pay crazy amounts зf money for some rare baseball card or something like that.\\n- Perceived scarcity will generate\\xa0[demand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand). For example, saying offers are available for a \"limited time only\" encourages sales. - ***Wikipedia***',\n",

Statistics show that the players who got helped perform better.\\n- Best time to buy a player is in his 20’s\\n\\n**\\n**\\n\\n**\\xa0\\xa0 3. The Worst \\xa0Business in the World: Why Soccer Clubs Don\\'t (and Shouldn’t) Make Money**\\n\\n- Even when clubs make money, it is crucial to invest it back in. Soccer should’t be a business. There is no\\xa0possible way it will be even remotly as big as say Walmart.\\n\\n![IMG_20150224_024452.jpg](:/7fe866db4795ffd586eea97618e13072)\\n![IMG_20150224_024540.jpg](:/616488a51e49d6e76d8c5d16c5273638)**\\n**\\n\\n**\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa04. Safer then the bank of England: Why Soccer Clubs Almost Never Disappear.**\\n\\n- For the rich clubs: those are so big, that if they disappear companies might go bankrupt too, people will turn away from firms that \"ruined\" their club.**\\xa0**So companies let big clubs’ debt go.\\n- For poor clubs: that’s peoples’ way of resting, getting away from problems. So, in the example of FC Aldershot, fans didn’t let the club go. What they did, is they collected money payed the debt and liquidated the club, so that anyone can buy shares and \"donate\"/invest money.\\n\\n**\\xa0 \\xa0 ! 5. In praise of Sugar Daddies: Why \"Financial Fair\\xa0Play\" is bad for soccer !**\\n\\n- FFP\\xa0wants all clubs to solve (pay it debts with their profits)\\n\\nThis rule affects poor clubs. This is because loaning companies are ready to drop some of the credit for rich clubs (since it is a brand), but not for poor clubs, so they are the ones who get hit. Btw, this rule only applies to clubs who qualify for European competitions.\\n\\n- Second\\xa0rule is that averaged over 3 years, club’s \"relevant income\" must match \"relevant expenses\"\\n\\nThis will also hurt poor clubs, since rich clubs can get money from their owners. If this happens, any competition will go.\\n\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0Even if this works\\xa0and clubs will become profitable, that\\xa0kills football, as we discussed earlier.\\n\\n**\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa06.

The Cult of the White Manager**![IMG_20150226_010956.jpg](:/5b66dfdfc9c75ff5fc051573f02eaae7)![IMG_20150226_011008.jpg](:/1db82e5e84f8e3c5e4df2f52724d58a2)\\n\\n**\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa08. The Economist’s Fear of the Penalty Kick: Are Penalties Socmically Unfair, or Only If You Are Nicolas Anelka?**\\n\\n- Almost all clubs now record players’ penalty\\xa0shoots, to predict what they next shot will be. Almost always this data is reliable, just like in Chelsea - Manchester\\xa0United (Champions League final match). Van der Sar got into Anelka’s mind, cause he started to notice the pattern which Chelsea’s statisticians picked up. Van der Sar jumps left.![IMG_20150226_011921.jpg](:/33411a7b38db3a78d884348fde8aa9d8)![IMG_20150226_011930.jpg](:/841577d2322e3f5c0f47c698ea95b21e)\\n\\n**\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa09. The Secret of Claude Makelele: How \"Match Data\" are changing the game on the field**\\n\\n- This chapter talks about deep statistics oа players and how do they affect managers decisions on what players to buy, what players to put in the starting squad. So, statistics helps managers to see insight on players’ game, which might be shown on the \"outside\".\\n\\n**\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa010. The Suburban\\xa0Newsagents: City Sizes and Soccer Prizes**\\n\\n- Industrial cities and cities with small population tend to have the best clubs. There are various reasons for that. The main one though\\xa0is that those small cities aren’t famous and that would be one of the way to make your city popular, to be more known.\\n\\n**\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa011. Football vs. Football**\\n\\n- This chapter talk about whether soccer or football is the right name for the game. And again *statistics* show that the word soccer came from England itself. That\\xa0in the past they used to call the game soccer as much as they did call it football. So, it is not something that Americans came up with.\\n\\n***Part 2 - The\\xa0Fans***\\n**\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa012.
